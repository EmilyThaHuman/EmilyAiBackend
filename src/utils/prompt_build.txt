    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data related to UI components, you can use the following guidelines and example code from the provided sources:

### Key Components and Features

1. **Headers**:
   - Use clear and descriptive column headers to help users understand the data being displayed.

2. **Rows and Cells**:
   - Ensure each row and cell is well-defined and easy to read. Use proper formatting and ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.

3. **Pagination**:
   - Implement pagination to handle large datasets effectively. This helps in splitting the data into manageable pages.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filtering and sorting features to allow users to quickly find specific data. This can be achieved through dropdown menus or search bars.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of chat bot UI data, you can use a tool like Form.io, which provides a Data Table as a Select Component. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to create such a component:

1. **Add the Data Source Component**:
   - Start by adding the Data Source component to the builder.
   - Within the settings, click the **Fetch** tab and add the URL of the JSON file containing the list of chat bot UI data.

2. **Configure the Trigger Component**:
   - Add a Checkbox and name the component 'Populate'.
   - Open the Data Source settings and click the **Trigger** tab.
   - Select the 'Populate' checkbox from the form as the trigger to execute the event.

3. **Define the Triggered Event**:
   - Set the Triggered Event to match the Data Source event, for example, 'populateState'.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of custom user prompts for a chat app, you can use UI components like those in UI Bakery or Retool. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Using UI Bakery

1. **Add a Table Component**:
   - Click the "Add Component" button and select the "Table" component from UI Bakery.

2. **Configure Columns**:
   - Dynamic columns can be configured using JavaScript mode. Click the JS button next to the columns section to enable dynamic mode.
   - Specify columns using an array of objects, defining properties like `prop` (data property to display), `type` (available types like 'number', 'string', 'text', etc.), and `primaryKey` (at least one column must be a primary key) if necessary.
This approach ensures that the data table component is intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing, making it easier for users to interact with and understand the data being displayed.
To generate a data table component for listing chat messages, you can follow these steps using UI Bakery:

1. **Create the Table Component**:
   - Add a table component to your UI Bakery project.
   - Connect your data source to the table by clicking the **Connect my data** button in the **Data** field of the table.

2. **Set Up Columns**:
   - Add columns for each piece of information you want to display, such as `id`, `sender`, `receiver`, and `text`.

3. **Customize Column Types**:
   - Set the type of each column according to the data type. For example, set `sender` and `receiver` to `Link` if you want to display user profiles, and set `text` to `String`.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filters to narrow down the data if necessary. For example, you can create a filter to show messages between specific users.

6. **Customization**:
   - Make the table fully customizable to fit the design theme. This includes choosing fonts, colors, and layouts that are visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Example Code

Using the `mantine-datatable` component from Mantine, you can create a lightweight, dependency-free table component that supports asynchronous data loading, pagination, and column sorting.

```javascript
import { Box } from '@mantine/core';
import { showNotification } from '@mantine/notifications';
import { DataTable } from 'mantine-datatable';

const data = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Joe Biden', bornIn: 1942, party: 'Democratic' },
  // More records...
];

const columns = [
  { accessor: 'id', title: '#', textAlign: 'right' },
  { accessor: 'name' },
  { accessor: 'party', render: ({ party }) => (
    <Box fw={700} c={party === 'Democratic' ? 'blue' : 'red'}>
      {party.slice(0, 3).toUpperCase()}
    </Box>
  ) },
  { accessor: 'bornIn' },
];

export function GettingStartedExample() {
  return (
    <DataTable
      withTableBorder
      borderRadius="sm"
      withColumnBorders
      striped
      highlightOnHover
      data={data}
      columns={columns}
      onRowClick={({ record }) => showNotification({
        title: `Clicked on ${record.name}`,
        message: `You clicked on ${record.name}, a ${record.party.toLowerCase()} president born in ${record.bornIn}`,
        withBorder: true,
      })}
    />
  );
}
```

### Additional Features

- **Row Expansion**: Allow rows to be expanded to show additional details. This can be useful for hierarchical data.
- **Nesting**: Support nested tables to display hierarchical data effectively.
- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Implement drag-and-drop functionality for rows or columns to reorder them.
- **Custom Cell Data Rendering**: Render cell data using custom components to enhance the appearance and functionality of the table.

This approach ensures that the data table component is intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing, making it easier for users to interact with and understand the data being displayed.
