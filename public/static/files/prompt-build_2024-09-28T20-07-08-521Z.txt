    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices – be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

"content": "# Creating a Data Table Component for a Vector Database List\n\nThe purpose of this component is to display data from a vector database in a readable and interactive format. This facilitates users to browse, filter, and understand complex data sets efficiently. The design rationale behind creating such a component includes improving data accessibility, enhancing user experience through interactive elements like sorting and pagination, and providing a clear visualization of vector similarities and differences.\n\n## Implementation using React\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nconst DataTable = ({ data }) => {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n  const [tableData, setTableData] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      try {\n        // Mock fetching data from vector DB\n        const response = await fetch('/api/vector-data');\n        const
Generate a data table compoennt for handlign Ai Prompt data
  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a data table component for a vector database list, you can use the following steps:

1. **Create a Vector Search Index**: Use a tool like Databricks' Mosaic AI Vector Search to create a vector search index from a Delta table. This index will include embedded data with metadata, allowing for efficient similarity searches.

2. **Choose the Embedding Method**: Decide how to provide vector embeddings. You can either have Databricks compute the embeddings or use pre-calculated embeddings from your Delta table.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data related to UI components, you can use the following guidelines and example code from the provided sources:

### Key Components and Features

1. **Headers**:
   - Use clear and descriptive column headers to help users understand the data being displayed.

2. **Rows and Cells**:
   - Ensure each row and cell is well-defined and easy to read. Use proper formatting and ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.

3. **Pagination**:
   - Implement pagination to handle large datasets effectively. This helps in splitting the data into manageable pages.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filtering and sorting features to allow users to quickly find specific data. This can be achieved through dropdown menus or search bars.
To generate a data table component for code tools, you can use the following approaches:

1. **UiPath**: You can use UiPath to generate a data table from unstructured data. The process involves using the Screen Scraping Wizard to extract data and then using the Generate Data Table activity to create a table from the scraped data.

2. **Form.io**: Form.io provides a Data Grid component that allows you to add multiple rows of field groupings. This can be used to create a structured data table by defining key-value pairs and customizing the grid's behavior.

3. **Commercetools UIKit**: This library provides a DataTable component that can render tabular data. You need to define the `rows` and `columns` lists as arrays of objects, where each column object has a unique `key` and a `label` for the header.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of custom user prompts for a chat app, you can use UI components like those in UI Bakery or Retool. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Using UI Bakery

1. **Add a Table Component**:
   - Click the "Add Component" button and select the "Table" component from UI Bakery.

2. **Configure Columns**:
   - Dynamic columns can be configured using JavaScript mode. Click the JS button next to the columns section to enable dynamic mode.
   - Specify columns using an array of objects, defining properties like `prop` (data property to display), `type` (available types like 'number', 'string', 'text', etc.), and `primaryKey` (at least one column must be a primary key) if necessary.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of chat bot UI data, you can use a tool like Form.io, which provides a Data Table as a Select Component. Here’s a step-by-step guide to create such a component:

1. **Add the Data Source Component**:
   - Start by adding the Data Source component to the builder.
   - Within the settings, click the **Fetch** tab and add the URL of the JSON file containing the list of chat bot UI data.

2. **Configure the Trigger Component**:
   - Add a Checkbox and name the component 'Populate'.
   - Open the Data Source settings and click the **Trigger** tab.
   - Select the 'Populate' checkbox from the form as the trigger to execute the event.

3. **Define the Triggered Event**:
   - Set the Triggered Event to match the Data Source event, for example, 'populateState'.

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database, you can use the `MaterialReactTable` component from the `material-react-table` library, which is built on top of TanStack Table and integrates well with Material UI. Here’s a concise example of how to implement it:

1. **Install the library**: 
   ```bash
   npm install material-react-table
   ```

2. **Import necessary components**:
   ```javascript
   import { useMemo } from 'react';
   import { MaterialReactTable, useMaterialReactTable, type MRT_ColumnDef } from 'material-react-table';
   ```

3. **Define the data structure**:
   ```javascript
   type Person = {
     name: { firstName: string; lastName: string; },
     address: string,
     city: string,
     state: string,
   };

   const data: Person[] = [
     {
       name: { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' },
       address: '261 Erdman Ford',
       city: 'East Daphne',
       state: 'Kentucky',
     },
     // Add more data points as needed
   ];
   ```

4. **Use the `useMaterialReactTable` hook to prepare the table data**:
   ```javascript
   const table = useMaterialReactTable({
     columns: [
       {
         accessorKey: 'name.firstName',
         header: 'First Name',
       },
       {
         accessorKey: 'name.lastName',
         header: 'Last Name',
       },
       {
         accessorKey: 'address',
         header: 'Address',
       },
       {
         accessorKey: 'city',
         header: 'City',
       },
       {
         accessorKey: 'state',
         header: 'State',
       },
     ],
     data,
   });
   ```

5. **Render the table using the `MaterialReactTable` component**:
   ```javascript
   return <MaterialReactTable table={table} />;
   ```

This setup ensures you have a customizable and efficient data table component that integrates well with Material UI and supports various features like sorting, pagination, and column customization.
