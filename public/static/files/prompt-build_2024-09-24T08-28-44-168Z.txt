    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filtering and sorting features to allow users to quickly find specific data. This can be achieved through dropdown menus or search bars.
To generate a data table component for organizing chatbot session data, you can use a combination of properties and attributes from various chatbot platforms and frameworks. Here is a sample data table component that includes relevant fields for organizing chatbot session data:
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of custom user prompts for a chat app, you can use UI components like those in UI Bakery or Retool. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Using UI Bakery

1. **Add a Table Component**:
   - Click the "Add Component" button and select the "Table" component from UI Bakery.

2. **Configure Columns**:
   - Dynamic columns can be configured using JavaScript mode. Click the JS button next to the columns section to enable dynamic mode.
   - Specify columns using an array of objects, defining properties like `prop` (data property to display), `type` (available types like 'number', 'string', 'text', etc.), and `primaryKey` (at least one column must be a primary key) if necessary.
This approach ensures that the data table component is intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing, making it easier for users to interact with and understand the data being displayed.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of chat bot UI data, you can use a tool like Form.io, which provides a Data Table as a Select Component. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to create such a component:

1. **Add the Data Source Component**:
   - Start by adding the Data Source component to the builder.
   - Within the settings, click the **Fetch** tab and add the URL of the JSON file containing the list of chat bot UI data.

2. **Configure the Trigger Component**:
   - Add a Checkbox and name the component 'Populate'.
   - Open the Data Source settings and click the **Trigger** tab.
   - Select the 'Populate' checkbox from the form as the trigger to execute the event.

3. **Define the Triggered Event**:
   - Set the Triggered Event to match the Data Source event, for example, 'populateState'.

  USER PROMPT/QUERY: Generate a data table component for organizing workspace and folder data

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate a data table component for organizing workspace and folder data, you can leverage the capabilities of Databricks, as described in the documentation provided by Databricks. Here is a concise guide:

1. **Create a Workspace**: Start by creating a Databricks workspace, which organizes objects like notebooks, libraries, dashboards, and experiments into folders and provides access to data objects and computational resources.

2. **Define Datasets**: Use the **Data** tab to define the underlying datasets for your workspace. You can create new queries against tables or views, or use existing Unity Catalog tables or views.

3. **Organize with Folders**: Organize your datasets and notebooks into folders within your workspace. This allows for easy management and access to data objects.

4. **Use Unity Catalog**: Utilize Unity Catalog for centralized access control, auditing, lineage, and data discovery capabilities. This helps in managing data across your workspaces effectively.

5. **Create a Dashboard**: Create a new dashboard from the dashboard listing page and define datasets using the **Data** tab. This will help in visualizing and organizing your workspace and folder data.

### Example Steps

1. **Start a Workspace**:
   - Open a project and click the **Workspaces** tab.
   - Click **Start a Workspace**.
   - Select the notebook type (e.g., JupyterLab, JupyterLab on Spark, RStudio, or VSCode).
   - Set the **Title** for the workspace.
   - Select datasets to add to your workspace (optional).
   - Choose an existing volume or create a new one (optional).
   - Click **Start workspace**.

2. **Define and Organize Datasets**:
   - Use the **Data** tab to define datasets as new queries or existing Unity Catalog tables/views.
   - Organize datasets into folders within your workspace.
   - Use Unity Catalog for centralized data management.

3. **Create a Dashboard**:
   - Click **Create** near the upper-right corner of the page to create a new dashboard.
   - Define datasets using the **Data** tab.
   - Organize dashboards into folders for better management.

### Data Table Component

To create a data table component for organizing workspace and folder data, you can:

- **Query Data**: Use SQL or Apache Spark SQL to query data from your defined datasets.
- **Display Data**: Use Databricks notebooks to display the queried data in a table format.
- **Customize Visualization**: Customize the visualization of the data table using Databricks' notebook features, such as adding filters, sorting, and formatting options.

### Summary

By following these steps, you can create a data table component for organizing workspace and folder data in Databricks. This involves creating a workspace, defining datasets, organizing them into folders, and using notebooks to display the data in a table format.
