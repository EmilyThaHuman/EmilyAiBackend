    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate a data table component for organizing styles, themes, and animations for each workspace in your project, you can use a combination of the features from various table components. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Grafana Table Visualization**:
   - Use Grafana's table visualization to display data in a flexible and customizable manner. You can add columns for styles, themes, and animations and use field overrides to customize the display of each column.
   - For example, you could have columns like "Style", "Theme", "Animation", and add custom cell data rendering to show detailed information about each style and theme.

2. **Vaadin Grid Component**:
   - Utilize the Vaadin Grid component for its extensive customization options. You can apply theme variants, customize style properties, and use CSS selectors to tailor the appearance of the grid.
   - For instance, you could use the `compact` theme variant to make the grid denser and reduce header and row heights, improving scannability and comparability between rows.

3. **Bootstrap Datatable**:
   - Bootstrap Datatable offers robust customization options and seamless integration with the Bootstrap framework. You can customize table headers, styling, and add additional features like buttons and dropdowns.
   - Use custom pagination and styling options to enhance the presentation and functionality of the table. For example, you can use the `striped` class to add alternating row colors, improving data scanning.

4. **Mantine DataTable**:
   - Mantine DataTable is lightweight and customizable, featuring asynchronous data loading support, pagination, and column sorting. You can customize the look and feel of the table and its components.
   - Use the `striped` option to add background colors to rows, making it easier to scan through data. Additionally, you can implement custom cell data rendering to show detailed information about each style and theme.

### Example Implementation

Hereâ€™s an example implementation using Mantine DataTable:

```html
import { Box } from '@mantine/core';
import { showNotification } from '@mantine/notifications';
import { DataTable } from 'mantine-datatable';

export function WorkspaceDataTable() {
  const data = [
    { id: 1, workspace: 'Workspace 1', style: 'Modern', theme: 'Dark', animation: 'Fade In' },
    { id: 2, workspace: 'Workspace 2', style: 'Minimalist', theme: 'Light', animation: 'Slide In' },
    { id: 3, workspace: 'Workspace 3', style: 'Retro', theme: 'Dark', animation: 'Zoom In' },
  ];

  const columns = [
    { accessor: 'id', title: '#', textAlign: 'right' },
    { accessor: 'workspace', title: 'Workspace' },
    { accessor: 'style', title: 'Style' },
    { accessor: 'theme', title: 'Theme' },
    { accessor: 'animation', title: 'Animation' },
  ];

  return (
    <Box>
      <DataTable
        withTableBorder
        borderRadius="sm"
        withColumnBorders
        striped
        highlightOnHover
        data={data}
        columns={columns}
      />
    </Box>
  );
}
```

This example uses Mantine DataTable to create a table that organizes styles, themes, and animations for each workspace. The `striped` option adds alternating row colors, and the table columns are customized to display the relevant information.
