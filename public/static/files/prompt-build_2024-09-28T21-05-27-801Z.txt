    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices – be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  USER PROMPT/QUERY: Generate a data table component for organizing a list of data for vector db table

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To create a vector search index, you can use Mosaic AI Vector Search within Databricks. There are three primary options for creating a vector search index:

1. **Delta Sync Index with Embeddings Computed by Databricks**:
   - **Description**: Databricks computes the embeddings using a specified model and optionally saves them to a table in Unity Catalog. The index automatically syncs with the Delta table as it updates.
   - **Example Code**:
     ```python
     client = VectorSearchClient()
     index = client.create_delta_sync_index(
         endpoint_name="vector_search_demo_endpoint",
         source_table_name="vector_search_demo.vector_search.en_wiki",
         index_name="vector_search_demo.vector_search.en_wiki_index",
         pipeline_type="TRIGGERED",
         primary_key="id",
         embedding_source_column="text",
         embedding_model_endpoint_name="e5-small-v2"
     )
     ```

2. **Delta Sync Index with Self-Managed Embeddings**:
   - **Description**: The source Delta table contains pre-calculated embeddings. The index stays synced with the Delta table as it updates.
   - **Example Code**:
     ```python
     client = VectorSearchClient()
     index = client.create_delta_sync_index(
         endpoint_name="vector_search_demo_endpoint",
         source_table_name="vector_search_demo.vector_search.en_wiki",
         index_name="vector_search_demo.vector_search.en_wiki_index",
         pipeline_type="TRIGGERED",
         primary_key="id",
         embedding_dimension=1024,
         embedding_vector_column="text_vector"
     )
     ```

3. **Direct Vector Access Index**:
   - **Description**: The user must manually update the index using the REST API or Python SDK when the embeddings table changes.
   - **Example Code**:
     ```python
     client = VectorSearchClient()
     index = client.create_direct_access_index(
         endpoint_name="storage_endpoint",
         index_name="{catalog_name}.{schema_name}.{index_name}",
         primary_key="id",
         embedding_dimension=1024,
         embedding_vector_column="text_vector",
         schema={
             "id": "int",
             "field2": "str",
             "field3": "float",
             "text_vector": "array<float>"
         }
     )
     ```

These options allow you to structure your vector search index to meet the specific needs of your application, whether it involves automatic syncing or manual updates.
