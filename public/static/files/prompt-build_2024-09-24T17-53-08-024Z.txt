    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.
	

    ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS: When responding to queries about React:

  CHAT CONTEXT: Generate a data table component for listing chat messages
Generate a reusable loading button
Generate a file manager component
"content": "# Creating a Data Table Component for Listing Chat Messages\n\nThe purpose of this Data Table component is to efficiently display a list of chat messages, allowing users to interact with and navigate through extensive conversations easily. It improves the overall user experience by organizing chat data in a structured and readable manner. This component leverages React's latest features for optimal performance and flexibility, providing developers with the capability to customize it according to their specific requirements.\n\n## Component Code\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst DataTable = ({ messages }) => {\n  return (\n    <table className=\"min-w-full leading-normal\">\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th className=\"px-5 py-3 border-b-2 border-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-gray-700 uppercase tracking-wider\">Sender</th>\n          <th className=\"px-5 py-3 border-b-2 border-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-left text-xs
</td>\n            <td className=\"px-5 py-3 border-b border-gray-200 bg-white text-sm\">\n              {message.text}\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n        ))}\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default DataTable;\n```\n\n## Usage Example\n\nTo use the `DataTable` component, you need to pass an array of message objects. Each object should include `sender`, `receiver`, and `text` properties. Here's how to render the component with some example chat messages:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport DataTable from './DataTable';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const sampleMessages = [\n    { sender: 'Alice', receiver: 'Bob', text: 'Hello, Bob!' },\n    { sender: 'Bob', receiver: 'Alice', text: 'Hi, Alice!' }\n  ];\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4\">\n      <DataTable messages={sampleMessages} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n## References\n\n- React Documentation:
  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a prompt template editor component, you can leverage the features of tools like Portkey AI and Salesforce Prompt Builder, which offer robust capabilities for creating, managing, and deploying prompt templates. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of how you can build such a component:

1. **Use a Templating Engine**: Utilize a templating engine like Mustache, which is used by Portkey AI under the hood. Mustache allows you to define variables and incorporate them into your prompts, making them extensible.

2. **Variable Definition**: Define variables within the template that can be passed at runtime. For example, in Portkey AI, you can use `{{customer_data}}` and `{{chat_query}}` as variables.

3. **API Integration**: Integrate the prompt template editor with an API to deploy the templates seamlessly. Portkey AI allows you to create and manage prompts with just an API call.
variables: {

"customer_data":"",

"chat_query":""

}

})
```

This template can be extended with more variables and Mustache tags to enhance its functionality.

### Conclusion

By combining these features and best practices, you can create a robust prompt template editor component that supports seamless creation, management, and deployment of LLM prompts.

### References Portkey Docs: Prompt Templates Amazon Bedrock: Design a Prompt Salesforce Help: Manage Prompt Templates
6. **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create, edit, and manage prompt templates. Salesforce Prompt Builder offers features like version management, activation, and deactivation, which can be integrated into your UI.

### Example Template

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might structure a prompt template using Mustache:

```plaintext
As you can see,

`{{customer_data}}` and

`{{chat_query}}` are defined as variables in the template and you can pass their value at the runtime:

```

```javascript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

const portkey = new Portkey()

const response = portkey.prompts.completions.create({

promptID: "pp-hr-bot-5c8c6e",

variables: {

"customer_data":"",

"chat_query":""

}

})
```

This template can be extended with more variables and Mustache tags to enhance its functionality.

### Conclusion
To generate a dropdown menu for a chat model, you can use various tools and frameworks depending on the platform and technology stack you are using. Here are some approaches:

1. **Google Workspace Chat**:
   - Use the `SelectionInput` widget to create a dropdown menu. This widget supports various selection types, including checkboxes, radio buttons, switches, and dropdown menus. You can dynamically source items from Google Workspace users or chat spaces using the `platformDataSource` field.

2. **Dialpad AI Chatbot**:
   - While Dialpad primarily focuses on creating chatbots with AI assistance, you can still use custom responses and choice menus to guide user selections. The `Choice` response type allows you to create menus linking 2 or more responses, which can be used to simulate a dropdown menu selection.

  USER PROMPT/QUERY: Generate a dialog for opening and viewing chat prompts

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate a dialog for opening and viewing chat prompts in Google Chat, you can follow these steps:

1. **Trigger the Dialog Request**: Use a slash command or a button click in a card message to trigger the dialog request. For example, configure a button's `onClick` action to set its `interaction` to `OPEN_DIALOG`.

2. **Respond to the Request**: When the user triggers the dialog request, your Chat app receives an interaction event with `dialogEventType` set to `REQUEST_DIALOG`. Respond to this event by returning an `actionResponse` object with the `type` set to `DIALOG` and include the dialog content.

3. **Dialog Content**: The dialog content can include form input widgets and buttons. For instance, you can create a button list with buttons that trigger actions like `open_next_dialog`, which opens a second dialog for adding more contact details.

Here is a sample JSON structure to open the initial dialog:

```json
"buttonList": {
  "buttons": [
    {
      "text": "Open Dialog",
      "onClick": {
        "action": {
          "function": "open_initial_dialog"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

And the corresponding function to open the initial dialog:

```python
def open_initial_dialog(request: Mapping[str, Any]) -> Mapping[str, Any]:
    return {
        "actionResponse": {
            "type": "DIALOG",
            "dialogAction": {
                "dialog": {
                    "body": {
                        "sections": [
                            {
                                "widgets": [
                                    {
                                        "buttonList": {
                                            "buttons": [
                                                {
                                                    "text": "Next",
                                                    "onClick": {
                                                        "action": {
                                                            "function": "open_next_dialog"
                                                        }
                                                    }
                                                }
                                            ]
                                        }
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

4. **Viewing Chat Prompts**: Once the dialog is open, you can include sections that display chat prompts. For example, you can add a text section that shows the prompt and buttons to interact with it.

```json
"dialogAction": {
    "dialog": {
        "body": {
            "sections": [
                {
                    "widgets": [
                        {
                            "text": {
                                "text": "Please select a prompt:",
                                "isMultiline": True
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "buttonList": {
                                "buttons": [
                                    {
                                        "text": "Select Prompt 1",
                                        "onClick": {
                                            "action": {
                                                "function": "handle_prompt_selection"
                                            }
                                        }
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "text": "Select Prompt 2",
                                        "onClick": {
                                            "action": {
                                                "function": "handle_prompt_selection"
                                            }
                                        }
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can create a dialog in Google Chat that allows users to open and view chat prompts interactively.

    Instructions:
        1. Provide your response in the "text" field.
        2. Use the "formatting" array to indicate any text that should be bold, italic, underlined, in code format, a link, or a header. Specify the start and end positions of the formatted text.
        3. If you include lists, use the "lists" array to specify bullet or numbered lists. Include the list items and their start and end positions in the main text.
        4. For code blocks, use the "codeBlocks" array. Specify the programming language, the code itself, and the start and end positions in the main text.
        5. If you create tables, use the "tables" array. Include headers, rows, and the start and end positions of the table in the main text.
        6. For mathematical expressions, use the "latex" array. Provide the LaTeX expression and its start and end positions in the main text.
        7. Ensure that all start and end positions accurately reflect the location of the elements in the main text.
        8. You may omit any sections that are not relevant to your response (e.g., if you don't use any LaTeX expressions, you can omit the "latex" array).
