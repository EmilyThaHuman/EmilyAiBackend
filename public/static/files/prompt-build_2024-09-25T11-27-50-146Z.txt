    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.
	

    ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS: When responding to queries about React:

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To create a `UserIconGrid` component that meets the described functional requirements, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging a grid component library like AG Grid for its robust features. Below is a high-level overview of how you can implement it:

1. **Grid Component Selection**:
   - Use a library like AG Grid, which supports responsive design, customizable icons, and accessibility features. AG Grid can handle complex grid configurations and provide a robust foundation for your requirements.
To generate a data table dialog with environment key forms, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and plugins installed. For example, in IntelliJ IDEA, you can enable the Database Tools and SQL plugin to manage data sources and database drivers.

2. **Create the Dialog Component**:
   - Use a UI component library to create a dialog box. For example, in Next.js, you can use the `Dialog` component from a UI library like `@material-ui` or `react-dialog` to create a modal dialog.

3. **Design the Form**:
   - Inside the dialog, design a form that includes input fields for the environment keys. You can use form libraries like `react-hook-form` to handle form state and validation.

4. **Add Form Validation**:
   - Define a schema to validate the intake of the form. This ensures that the data entered by the user is correct and consistent.
function selectIcon(icon) {
        // Trigger callback function
        console.log(`Selected Icon: ${icon}`);
        
        // Highlight selected icon
        document.querySelector(`img[alt="${icon}"]`).style.border = "1px solid blue";
        
        // Clear previously selected icon's highlight (if any)
        document.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
            if (img.alt !== icon) {
                img.style.border = "";
            }
        });
    }
</script>
```

This example demonstrates how to create a responsive grid with customizable icons, handle icon selection, and apply visual effects. It also includes basic accessibility features like ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
2. **Grid Configuration**:
   - **Display Grid**: Use AG Grid's column properties to configure the grid. Ensure the grid is responsive by using `autoHeight` and `wrap` properties to adjust column widths based on screen size.
   - **Icon Selection**: Implement a custom renderer for each cell to handle icon selection. When an icon is clicked, highlight it by adding a border or changing the background color. Only one icon should be selected at a time.
   - **Callback Function**: Trigger a callback function with the selected icon's details when an icon is selected. This can be achieved by using AG Grid's event handling capabilities.
   - **Hover Effect**: Apply a subtle hover effect on each icon using CSS to enhance UX.
   - **Responsive Design**: Ensure the grid scales appropriately for mobile and desktop views. On smaller screens, reduce the number of columns while keeping icons large enough to be clickable.
To generate a dialog for opening and viewing chat prompts in Google Chat, you can follow these steps:

1. **Trigger the Dialog Request**: Use a slash command or a button click in a card message to trigger the dialog request. For example, configure a button's `onClick` action to set its `interaction` to `OPEN_DIALOG`.

2. **Respond to the Request**: When the user triggers the dialog request, your Chat app receives an interaction event with `dialogEventType` set to `REQUEST_DIALOG`. Respond to this event by returning an `actionResponse` object with the `type` set to `DIALOG` and include the dialog content.

3. **Dialog Content**: The dialog content can include form input widgets and buttons. For instance, you can create a button list with buttons that trigger actions like `open_next_dialog`, which opens a second dialog for adding more contact details.

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate a styled dialog component that displays a user icon grid and includes select and save functionality, you can use a combination of Radix Vue for the dialog component and customize it with your requirements. Here is an example of how you might achieve this:

### Dialog Component
```html
<template>
  <DialogRoot>
    <DialogTrigger class="text-grass11 font-semibold shadow-blackA7 hover:bg-mauve3 inline-flex h-[35px] items-center justify-center rounded-[4px] bg-white px-[15px] leading-none shadow-[0_2px_10px] focus:shadow-[0_0_0_2px] focus:shadow-black focus:outline-none">
      Open Dialog
    </DialogTrigger>
    <DialogContent class="text-mauve11 mt-[10px] mb-5 text-[15px] leading-normal">
      <div class="mt-[25px] flex justify-center">
        <!-- User Icon Grid -->
        <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          <!-- Example User Icon Items -->
          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="user-icon-1.jpg" alt="User Icon 1" />
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="user-icon-2.jpg" alt="User Icon 2" />
          </div>
          <!-- Add more user icons as needed -->
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- Select and Save Logic -->
      <div class="mt-[25px] flex justify-end">
        <DialogClose as-child>
          <button class="bg-green4 text-green11 hover:bg-green5 focus:shadow-green7 inline-flex h-[35px] items-center justify-center rounded-[4px] px-[15px] font-semibold leading-none focus:shadow-[0_0_0_2px] focus:outline-none">
            Save Changes
          </button>
        </DialogClose>
      </div>
    </DialogContent>
  </DialogRoot>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { 
  DialogClose, 
  DialogContent, 
  DialogDescription, 
  DialogOverlay, 
  DialogPortal, 
  DialogRoot, 
  DialogTrigger 
} from 'radix-vue';

// Import Iconify Vue for icons if needed.
import { Icon } from '@iconify/vue';
</script>
```

### Explanation
1. **Dialog Trigger**: The `DialogTrigger` component is used to open the dialog. It is styled with a text color, font, and hover effects.
2. **Dialog Content**: The `DialogContent` component contains the main content of the dialog. It includes a grid displaying user icons and a save button.
3. **User Icon Grid**: The grid is created using HTML and CSS grid properties. Each grid item contains an image representing a user icon.
4. **Select and Save Logic**: The save button is styled and positioned at the end of the dialog content. When clicked, it triggers the save changes logic.

### Customization
You can further customize the dialog by adding more features such as animations, custom styles, and additional functionality using Radix Vue's API and CSS customization options.

### Example Use Case
This dialog component can be used in various applications where users need to select and save a set of icons or other data. For instance, in a social media app, users might use this dialog to select their profile icons.
