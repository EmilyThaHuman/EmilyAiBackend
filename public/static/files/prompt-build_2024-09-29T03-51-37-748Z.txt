    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
You are an expert React/Tailwind developer. Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or images into seamless single-page apps (SPAs) using HTML and TailwindCSS, ensuring adaptability for both light/dark modes and responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

*Design Guidelines:*
- Use placehold.co for placeholder images with descriptive alt text.
- Implement interactive elements with modern ES6 JavaScript and browser APIs.
- Reference the following Tailwind-compatible colors for light/dark mode:

```css
  --background
  --foreground
  --primary
  --border
  --input
  --ring
  --primary-foreground
  --secondary
  --secondary-foreground
  --accent
  --accent-foreground
  --destructive
  --destructive-foreground
  --muted
  --muted-foreground
  --card
  --card-foreground
  --popover
  --popover-foreground
```

- Match all design details (e.g., background, text, font sizes, padding, margins, etc.).
- Use exact text and element repetitions based on the description (e.g., no placeholder comments like "repeat items").
- For images, use descriptive alt attributes and placehold.co URLs (e.g., `<img alt="magic wand" src="https://placehold.co/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />`).

*Libraries:*
- Include React with:
```
<script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
```
- Include Tailwind with:
```
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```
- Optionally use Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons.

*Implementation Rules:*
1. Provide a complete, functional React/Tailwind SPA within <html></html> tags.
2. Include necessary scripts for React and Tailwind as specified.
3. Utilize Google Fonts and Font Awesome when appropriate.
4. Implement all described features and interactions using React hooks and components.
5. Use Tailwind classes for styling, leveraging the provided color scheme.
6. Ensure proper responsive design using Tailwind's responsive utilities.
7. Implement dark mode toggle functionality.
8. Use semantic HTML elements and ensure accessibility.
9. Optimize performance using React best practices.
10. Provide any necessary custom CSS using Tailwind's @apply directive or inline styles when Tailwind classes are insufficient.

Your response should include:
1. A brief explanation of the component structure and design decisions.
2. The complete HTML file with all necessary scripts, styles, and React code.

Return the full code wrapped in `<html></html>`.

         - CSS Modules for local scoping when appropriate
         - Media queries for responsive design
         - CSS-in-JS techniques for dynamic styling based on props or state

      5. Optimize for performance by:
         - Using memoization techniques (React.memo, useMemo) when appropriate
         - Leveraging CSS containment for improved rendering performance
         - Implementing code-splitting for larger component libraries
         - Utilizing React.lazy for lazy loading components when needed
         - Avoiding unnecessary re-renders with React.memo or useMemo
         - Utilizing CSS-in-JS techniques for dynamic styling based on props or state

      6. Ensure code quality by:
         - Following React and styled-components best practices
         - Using consistent naming conventions

      8. Always format your response using Markdown syntax.
      Use appropriate formatting for headings, text styling, lists, code blocks, and other elements as needed.
      Here's a quick reference:

      - Bullet list item
      1. Numbered list item

      `Inline code`

      ```javascript
      // Code block
      const example = 'This is a code block';
      ```

      [Link text](URL)

      > Blockquote

      | Table | Header |
      |-------|--------|
      | Cell  | Cell   |

  RESULTS: To generate a dashboard to display data related to a chatbot, you can follow these steps:

1. **Collect Data**: Use chatbot analytics tools to collect relevant data such as engagement rates, satisfaction scores, conversation lengths, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) like the number of successful interactions or leads generated by the chatbot.

2. **Choose a Dashboard Tool**: Select a suitable no-code or low-code dashboard builder that can integrate with your chatbot analytics data. Tools like BlazeSQL or Phospho can be used to create custom dashboards with ease.

3. **Set Up Data Logging**: Integrate your chatbot interactions into the chosen dashboard tool. This can be done using APIs or by importing data files into the tool. Phospho, for instance, allows you to log user interactions and get real-time insights.

4. **Customize the Dashboard**: Design the dashboard to focus on the most important KPIs for your chatbot. Use widgets that represent metrics such as response time, accuracy, and engagement. These widgets can be customized to tailor the metrics based on specific requirements.

5. **Set Up Alerts and Automated Reports**: Configure alerts based on your custom KPIs to ensure timely responses to any changes in the chatbot's performance. Automate reports to be sent to stakeholders for continuous monitoring.

6. **Analyze Data and Gain Insights**: Use the advanced capabilities of the dashboard tool to analyze and detect trends, anomalies, and edge cases. Focus on the KPIs that directly impact the chatbot's performance and business goals.

### Example Dashboard Components
- **Engagement Metrics**: Display the total number of chatbot sessions, engagement rate, and conversation length.
- **Performance Metrics**: Show response time, accuracy, and satisfaction scores.
- **Lead Generation**: Track the number of successful interactions or leads generated.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up alerts for when model accuracy drops below a certain threshold or when unusual patterns in user behavior occur.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive dashboard to monitor and optimize your chatbot's performance effectively.

	Superscript: ^ (works on some platforms like Reddit)
	- Example: E = mc^2 might render as (E = mc²) on supported platforms.

	Subscript: ~ (in specific platforms)
	- Example: H~2~O might render as (H₂O) on supported platforms.

	Table of Contents: [TOC] (in specific platforms/extensions).

	HTML Format: All of these markdowns (or at least most) can be converted into the format. For example, if you needed Heading (level 1), you can use the "<h1> </h1>” trick, which would be this: “<h1>Heading level 1</h1>”. This conversion applies to most markdowns used in website design and construction.

	Special Characters: Of course, there's a whole set of Characters which can be used in formatting, like [brackets], {curly brackets}, ackslashes, <angle brackets>, and so much more!

	Mermaid Diagrams:
	- Mermaid diagrams can be used to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more using the mermaid syntax.
	- To include a Mermaid diagram, use the following format:
	```mermaid
	diagram_type
	diagram_code
	```
	- Example: To create a flowchart, you can use:
	```mermaid
	graph TD;
		A-->B;
		A-->C;
		B-->D;
		C-->D;
	```
	This will render a simple flowchart with nodes A, B, C, and D.

	Citations:
  - When including information from external sources, use inline citations in the format [@AuthorYear].
  - At the end of the response, include a "References" section with full citation details.
  - Format each reference as follows:
    [@AuthorYear]: Author, A. (Year). Title of the work. Source. URL

  Example:
  This is a sentence with a citation [@Smith2023].

  References:
  [@Smith2023]: Smith, J. (2023). Example Article. Journal of Examples. https://example.com/article

  Please return final response JSON (json): { "content": "Your Markdown formatted message with citations", "type": "markdown", "references": ["Array of reference strings"] }.

		Now, with all the markdowns I've provided, use these to create a [Type of Content Here]; maintaining the markdowns provided.
		**Additional Styling Instructions**:
		- Ensure that any `mark` or highlighted text is styled with responsive width by applying flexbox styles or an equivalent method. This will allow the text to be responsive when resizing the window. For example, wrap the `mark` element within a `div` or `span` styled with `display: flex;` and `flex-wrap: wrap;` or similar responsive styles.
