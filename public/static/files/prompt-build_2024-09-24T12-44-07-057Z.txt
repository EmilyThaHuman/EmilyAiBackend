    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

### Citations

1. Nuxeo Documentation on File Manager
2. Syncfusion's Angular FileManager Component
3. Syncfusion's React FileManager Component
4. Custom React Implementation for File Upload
3. **Custom React Implementation**:
   - **Description**: You can also implement a custom file manager component using React.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create a React application using `create-react-app`.
     - Implement a file uploader component using `FormData` and `fetch` to handle file uploads. This approach allows you to manage file details and upload logic within your application.

### Example Implementation

#### Using Syncfusion's React FileManager Component

```typescript
import { FileManagerComponent } from '@syncfusion/ej2-react-filemanager';
import * as React from 'react';

function App() {
  let hostUrl = "https://ej2-aspcore-service.azurewebsites.net/";

  return (
    <div className="control-section">
      <FileManagerComponent id="file" ajaxSettings={{ url: hostUrl + "api/FileManager/FileOperations" }}/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Using Custom React Implementation

```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
<script>
import { Tree } from 'radix-vue';

export default {
  components: { Tree },
  data() {
    return {
      treeItems: [
        {
          title: 'File 1',
          children: [
            { title: 'Subfile 1' },
            { title: 'Subfile 2' },
          ],
        },
        {
          title: 'File 2',
          children: [
            { title: 'Subfile 3' },
            { title: 'Subfile 4' },
          ],
        },
      ],
      expanded: [],
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleUpdate(value) {
      this.treeItems = value;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

#### Using Bootstrap Treeview
To generate a React menu display, you can use a combination of components and libraries like React, Tailwind CSS, and Mobiscroll. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to create a responsive dropdown menu:

### Step 1: Set Up Your React App

First, create a new React app using `create-react-app`:
```bash
npx create-react-app react-menu-app
cd react-menu-app
```

### Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS and Mobiscroll

Install Tailwind CSS and Mobiscroll:
```bash
npm install tailwindcss mobiscroll-react
```

### Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS

Configure Tailwind CSS by creating a `tailwind.config.js` file and adding the necessary plugins:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### Step 4: Create the Dropdown Menu Component
To generate a file tree structure component with editable file tree items and a highly precise state management system, you can combine elements from several libraries and frameworks. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Use a Tree Component Library**:
   - **Radix Vue Tree**: This component allows for selecting multiple items and provides a robust set of properties for managing the tree structure. It supports controlled state management and customizable behavior.
   - **Bootstrap Treeview**: This example from Mobirise provides interactive tree nodes, checkboxes for multiple selection, and flexibility in customization. It is designed to be responsive and can be integrated seamlessly into various projects.

2. **Implement Editable Nodes**:
   - **Bootstrap Treeview Example**: The example includes the ability to edit node labels or content directly within the treeview. This feature can be leveraged to make the tree items editable.
