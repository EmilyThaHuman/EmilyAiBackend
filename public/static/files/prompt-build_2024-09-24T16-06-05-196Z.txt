    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: An accordion component is a UI element that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content, typically used to manage large amounts of information. Key features of an accordion include:

- **Customizable Headers with Icons**: Accordion headers can include icons to indicate the open or closed state of the section, such as plus and minus signs.
- **Hover Effects**: Many accordions support hover effects, providing visual cues for user interaction.
- **Multiple Open Sections**: Some accordions allow multiple sections to be open at the same time, while others restrict it to only one open section.
- **Animated Transitions**: Accordion components often feature smooth animations when expanding or collapsing sections, enhancing the user experience.

To ensure accessibility, accordion components should be designed with keyboard navigation in mind, using ARIA attributes to indicate the expanded state, and ensuring that all focusable elements are included in the pageâ€™s tab order sequence.
### Implementation Examples

1. **Material Tailwind Accordion**:
   - Uses Tailwind CSS with Material Design styles, providing expand/collapse icons and customizable headers.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <div class="border-b border-slate-200">
       <button disabled onclick="...">
         <path d="M8.75 3.75a.75.75 0 0 0-1.5 0v3.5h-3.5a.75.75 0 0 0 0 1.5h3.5v3.5a.75.75 0 0 0 1.5 0v-3.5h3.5a.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.5h-3.5v-3.5Z" />
       </svg>
       </span>
       </button>
       <div id="content-1" class="max-h-0 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out">
         <div class="pb-5 text-sm text-slate-500">Material Tailwind is a framework that enhances Tailwind CSS with additional styles and components.</div>
       </div>
     </div>
     ```
3. **Carbon Design System Accordion**:
   - Features a chevron icon to indicate the collapsed or expanded state and supports keyboard navigation with Tab/Shift+Tab keys.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <div role="button" aria-expanded="false" onclick="...">
       <path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M11.78 9.78a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06 0L8 7.06 5.28 9.78a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06-1.06l3.25-3.25a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06 0l3.25 3.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06Z" clip-rule="evenodd" />
       </svg>
       </span>
       </button>
       <div id="content-3" class="max-h-0 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out">
         <div class="pb-5 text-sm text-slate-500">The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure.</div>
       </div>
     </div>
     ```

3. **Visual Features**:
   - **Selected Icon Highlight**: Apply a visual effect (e.g., colored border or shadow) to clearly show the currently selected icon.
   - **Grid Animation**: Smoothly animate the appearance of icons when the component is rendered using CSS animations or transitions.
   - **Icons with Tooltips**: Optionally display a tooltip with the icon's name or description when hovered over using HTML5 tooltips or a library like Popper.js.
   - **Placeholder Icons**: Optionally display placeholder icons for missing or undefined user icons using a custom renderer.

Hereâ€™s a simplified example using AG Grid:

```html
<ag-grid-angular 
    [columnDefs]="columnDefs" 
    [rowData]="rowData" 
    (onCellClicked)="onCellClicked($event)" 
    style="width: 100%; height: 100%"></ag-grid-angular>

  USER PROMPT/QUERY: Expandable List Item





Description: A list item that can be expanded to reveal more details.



Unique Features:





Expand/Collapse: Clicking on the item expands it to show additional information.



Smooth Toggle: Includes a smooth animation when expanding or collapsing the item.



Custom Icons: Configurable icons for expanded and collapsed states (e.g., a plus/minus icon).

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To create an expandable list item in Flutter, you can use the `Expandable` widget provided by FlutterFlow. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to implement it:

1. **Add the Expandable Widget**:
   - In your Flutter project, add the `Expandable` widget from the FlutterFlow documentation. This widget allows you to dynamically show or hide content by tapping on a header.

2. **Default Widget Tree**:
   - The default widget tree for an `Expandable` widget typically includes:
     - **Header**: The visible part of the widget when it is both collapsed and expanded. This usually contains a label or icon indicating what the expandable content relates to.
     - **Collapsed View**: The default state showing minimal content or summarization.
     - **Expanded View**: Contains more detailed information or additional controls that are visible when the widget is expanded.

3. **Customization**:
   - **Icon Properties**: You can configure icons for the expanded and collapsed states, such as a plus/minus icon.
   - **Active View**: Specifies whether the widget is currently in the collapsed or expanded state.
   - **Initially Expanded**: Determines if the widget should be expanded by default when the view is first loaded.
   - **Tap Header to Toggle**: Allows the user to expand or collapse the content by tapping the header.
   - **Tap Body to Expand/Collapse**: Defines whether tapping on the body of the expanded content can toggle its state.
   - **Style Properties**: You can set dimensions, background color, and header alignment to customize the widget.

Here is a simple example of how you might use the `Expandable` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  bool _isExpanded = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Expandable List Item'),
      ),
      body: ListView(
        children: [
          Expandable(
            initialOpen: _isExpanded,
            title: 'Header',
            children: [
              Text('This is some detailed information'),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  setState(() {
                    _isExpanded = !_isExpanded;
                  });
                },
                child: Text(_isExpanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation of an expandable list item using the `Expandable` widget from FlutterFlow. The item can be expanded or collapsed by tapping on the header, and it includes a smooth animation for toggling.
