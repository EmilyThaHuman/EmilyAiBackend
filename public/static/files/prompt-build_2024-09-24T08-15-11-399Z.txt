    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  CHAT CONTEXT: Generate a data table component for listing chat messages
Generate a data table component for organizing a list of data related to UI componets
"content": "# Creating a Data Table Component for Listing Chat Messages\n\nThe purpose of this Data Table component is to efficiently display a list of chat messages, allowing users to interact with and navigate through extensive conversations easily. It improves the overall user experience by organizing chat data in a structured and readable manner. This component leverages React's latest features for optimal performance and flexibility, providing developers with the capability to customize it according to their specific requirements.\n\n## Component Code\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst DataTable = ({ messages }) => {\n  return (\n    <table className=\"min-w-full leading-normal\">\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th className=\"px-5 py-3 border-b-2 border-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-gray-700 uppercase tracking-wider\">Sender</th>\n          <th className=\"px-5 py-3 border-b-2 border-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-left text-xs
Generate a data table component for a vector db list
</td>\n            <td className=\"px-5 py-3 border-b border-gray-200 bg-white text-sm\">\n              {message.text}\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n        ))}\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default DataTable;\n```\n\n## Usage Example\n\nTo use the `DataTable` component, you need to pass an array of message objects. Each object should include `sender`, `receiver`, and `text` properties. Here's how to render the component with some example chat messages:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport DataTable from './DataTable';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const sampleMessages = [\n    { sender: 'Alice', receiver: 'Bob', text: 'Hello, Bob!' },\n    { sender: 'Bob', receiver: 'Alice', text: 'Hi, Alice!' }\n  ];\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto px-4\">\n      <DataTable messages={sampleMessages} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n## References\n\n- React Documentation:

To generate a data table component for organizing a list of chat bot UI data, you can use a tool like Form.io, which provides a Data Table as a Select Component. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to create such a component:

1. **Add the Data Source Component**:
   - Start by adding the Data Source component to the builder.
   - Within the settings, click the **Fetch** tab and add the URL of the JSON file containing the list of chat bot UI data.

2. **Configure the Trigger Component**:
   - Add a Checkbox and name the component 'Populate'.
   - Open the Data Source settings and click the **Trigger** tab.
   - Select the 'Populate' checkbox from the form as the trigger to execute the event.

3. **Define the Triggered Event**:
   - Set the Triggered Event to match the Data Source event, for example, 'populateState'.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of chatbot preset data, you can follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Platform**: Select a platform that supports data table components, such as Google Sheets or a form builder like Form.io.

2. **Prepare Data**: Ensure your data is in a structured format, ideally in a JSON or CSV file.

3. **Use Google Sheets**:
   - **Manual Method**: Highlight the text, go to `Data`, and select `Split text to columns` to split the data into separate columns.
   - **Automate with Formulas**: Use the `ARRAYFORMULA` function to convert a single column of names into a table with multiple columns.
   - **Add-ons**: Utilize add-ons like BulletsToTable.com, Power Tools, or Table Formatter to convert text to tables and customize formatting.
