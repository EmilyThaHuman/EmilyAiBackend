    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices – be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database, you can use the `MaterialReactTable` component from the `material-react-table` library, which is built on top of TanStack Table and integrates well with Material UI. Here’s a concise example of how to implement it:

1. **Install the library**: 
   ```bash
   npm install material-react-table
   ```

2. **Import necessary components**:
   ```javascript
   import { useMemo } from 'react';
   import { MaterialReactTable, useMaterialReactTable, type MRT_ColumnDef } from 'material-react-table';
   ```

3. **Define the data structure**:
   ```javascript
   type Person = {
     name: { firstName: string; lastName: string; },
     address: string,
     city: string,
     state: string,
   };
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data, particularly for tracking UI library documents that have been upserted into a database for projects, you can use a combination of **TanStack Table** and **Material UI**. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Install `material-react-table` and `@material-ui/core` using npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install material-react-table @material-ui/core
   ```

2. **Set Up the Table Component**:
   - Import the necessary components and hooks:
   ```javascript
   import { useMemo } from 'react';
   import { MaterialReactTable, useMaterialReactTable, type MRT_ColumnDef } from 'material-react-table';
   import { TableContainer, Table, TableHead, TableBody, TableRow, TableCell, Paper, TableSortLabel } from '@material-ui/core';
   ```
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data related to UI components, you can use the following guidelines and example code from the provided sources:

### Key Components and Features

1. **Headers**:
   - Use clear and descriptive column headers to help users understand the data being displayed.

2. **Rows and Cells**:
   - Ensure each row and cell is well-defined and easy to read. Use proper formatting and ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.

3. **Pagination**:
   - Implement pagination to handle large datasets effectively. This helps in splitting the data into manageable pages.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filtering and sorting features to allow users to quickly find specific data. This can be achieved through dropdown menus or search bars.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of project data, you can use the following approaches:

1. **Material React Table**: This library offers a comprehensive data grid component with features like pagination, sorting, filtering, and row selection. You can customize it extensively using Material UI components and the `useMaterialReactTable` hook.

2. **TanStack Table**: This library provides a robust set of features for creating tables, including client-side sorting, filtering, and pagination. It is highly customizable and can be integrated with other React components.

3. **SVAR DataGrid (Svelte)**: If you are using Svelte, SVAR DataGrid offers a ready-to-use UI component that supports sorting, searching, and paging functionality. It is lightweight and easy to integrate with Svelte applications.

### Example Using Material React Table

Here is a basic example of creating a data table using Material React Table:
To generate a data table component for a vector database list, you can use the following steps:

1. **Create a Vector Search Index**: Use a tool like Databricks' Mosaic AI Vector Search to create a vector search index from a Delta table. This index will include embedded data with metadata, allowing for efficient similarity searches.

2. **Choose the Embedding Method**: Decide how to provide vector embeddings. You can either have Databricks compute the embeddings or use pre-calculated embeddings from your Delta table.

      accessorKey: 'address',
      header: 'Address',
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'city',
      header: 'City',
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'state',
      header: 'State',
    },
  ],
  data,
});

return (
  <div style={{ height: 300 }}>
    <MaterialReactTable table={table} />
  </div>
);
```
