    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a dropdown menu for a chat model, you can use various tools and frameworks depending on the platform and technology stack you are using. Here are some approaches:

1. **Google Workspace Chat**:
   - Use the `SelectionInput` widget to create a dropdown menu. This widget supports various selection types, including checkboxes, radio buttons, switches, and dropdown menus. You can dynamically source items from Google Workspace users or chat spaces using the `platformDataSource` field.

2. **Dialpad AI Chatbot**:
   - While Dialpad primarily focuses on creating chatbots with AI assistance, you can still use custom responses and choice menus to guide user selections. The `Choice` response type allows you to create menus linking 2 or more responses, which can be used to simulate a dropdown menu selection.
3. **Flutter**:
   - If you are building a mobile app using Flutter, you can use various dropdown packages such as `animated_custom_dropdown`, `multi_dropdown`, or `drop_down_list`. These packages offer highly customizable widgets that support single and multiple selections, search functionality, and more.

4. **WooCommerce**:
   - If you are integrating a dropdown menu into an e-commerce platform like WooCommerce, you can use the WooCommerce Product Table plugin to create dropdown lists for product variations. This plugin allows you to display variations as dropdown lists on the shop page and other parts of your store.

### Summary

- **Google Workspace Chat**: Use the `SelectionInput` widget for dynamic dropdown menus.
- **Dialpad AI Chatbot**: Utilize custom responses and choice menus.
- **Flutter**: Employ customizable dropdown packages.
- **WooCommerce**: Leverage the WooCommerce Product Table plugin for e-commerce applications.

To generate a data table component for organizing a list of chat bot UI data, you can use a tool like Form.io, which provides a Data Table as a Select Component. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to create such a component:

1. **Add the Data Source Component**:
   - Start by adding the Data Source component to the builder.
   - Within the settings, click the **Fetch** tab and add the URL of the JSON file containing the list of chat bot UI data.

2. **Configure the Trigger Component**:
   - Add a Checkbox and name the component 'Populate'.
   - Open the Data Source settings and click the **Trigger** tab.
   - Select the 'Populate' checkbox from the form as the trigger to execute the event.

3. **Define the Triggered Event**:
   - Set the Triggered Event to match the Data Source event, for example, 'populateState'.
### Step 4: Create the Dropdown Menu Component

Create a new component `DropdownMenu.js` in the `src` directory:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Select } from 'mobiscroll-react';
import './DropdownMenu.css';

const DropdownMenu = () => {
  const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = useState('Option 1');

  const options = [
    { value: 'Option 1', text: 'Option 1' },
    { value: 'Option 2', text: 'Option 2' },
    { value: 'Option 3', text: 'Option 3' },
  ];

  return (
    <div className="relative">
      <Select
        data={options}
        value={selectedOption}
        onChange={(event) => setSelectedOption(event.value)}
        placeholder="Select an Option"
        displayMode="bottom"
      />
      <div className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-y-0 right-0 flex items-center px-2 text-gray-700">
        <i className="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DropdownMenu;
```
To generate a data table component for listing chat messages, you can follow these steps using UI Bakery:

1. **Create the Table Component**:
   - Add a table component to your UI Bakery project.
   - Connect your data source to the table by clicking the **Connect my data** button in the **Data** field of the table.

2. **Set Up Columns**:
   - Add columns for each piece of information you want to display, such as `id`, `sender`, `receiver`, and `text`.

3. **Customize Column Types**:
   - Set the type of each column according to the data type. For example, set `sender` and `receiver` to `Link` if you want to display user profiles, and set `text` to `String`.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filters to narrow down the data if necessary. For example, you can create a filter to show messages between specific users.
