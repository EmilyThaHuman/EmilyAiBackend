    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a chatbot dashboard layout with a sidebar navigation, header, and chat history data, you can incorporate the following components:

1. **Header**:
   - **Navigation Bar**: Include buttons or links for main navigation such as "Chat History," "Settings," and "Help."
   - **User Profile**: Display the user's profile information, such as their name and avatar.

2. **Sidebar Navigation**:
   - **Chat History**: A list or grid view of previous conversations, with options to filter by date, user, or conversation type.
   - **Settings**: Options to manage chatbot settings, such as customizing triggers, actions, and integrations.
   - **Help**: Links to FAQs, documentation, or support resources.
To generate a styled dialog component that displays a user icon grid and includes select and save functionality, you can use a combination of Radix Vue for the dialog component and customize it with your requirements. Here is an example of how you might achieve this:
To generate a sidebar with a file directory management component in a dark theme, you can use the following steps and components:

1. **Theme Configuration**:
   - Use a dark theme for the overall application. This can be achieved by setting the theme color scheme to dark mode in the application settings, as shown in.

2. **Sidebar Customization**:
   - For Obsidian, you can use CSS snippets to customize the sidebar. For example, the `Hide Ribbon` and `Native Scrollbar styles` snippets can help in maintaining a clean and dark appearance for the sidebar.

3. **File Directory Management Component**:
   - If you're using Obsidian, you can enable plugins like `dataview` or `omnisearch` which provide functionalities for managing files and directories within the sidebar.
   - For a more customized approach, you can use the `Meta Bind (Compact)` snippet to make inline controls more compact, which might be useful for managing directories within the sidebar.
<script setup lang="ts">
import { 
  DialogClose, 
  DialogContent, 
  DialogDescription, 
  DialogOverlay, 
  DialogPortal, 
  DialogRoot, 
  DialogTrigger 
} from 'radix-vue';

// Import Iconify Vue for icons if needed.
import { Icon } from '@iconify/vue';
</script>
```

### Explanation
1. **Dialog Trigger**: The `DialogTrigger` component is used to open the dialog. It is styled with a text color, font, and hover effects.
2. **Dialog Content**: The `DialogContent` component contains the main content of the dialog. It includes a grid displaying user icons and a save button.
3. **User Icon Grid**: The grid is created using HTML and CSS grid properties. Each grid item contains an image representing a user icon.
4. **Select and Save Logic**: The save button is styled and positioned at the end of the dialog content. When clicked, it triggers the save changes logic.

  USER PROMPT/QUERY: Generate a user settings sidebar panel containing forms for updating and viewing user info

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate a user settings sidebar panel containing forms for updating and viewing user info, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a high-level approach using the Google Apps Script and HTML service to create a custom sidebar in Google Docs, Forms, Slides, and Sheets:

1. **Create the Sidebar Structure**:
   - Use HTML to design the layout of the sidebar, including forms for updating and viewing user info.

2. **Add JavaScript for Form Interactions**:
   - Use JavaScript to handle form submissions and updates.

3. **Integrate with Google Apps Script**:
   - Use the `HtmlService` to create the HTML output and `Ui.showSidebar()` to open the sidebar.

Hereâ€™s an example implementation:

### Step 1: Create the HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>User Settings Sidebar</title>
    <style>
        /* Basic styling for the sidebar */
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            width: 250px;
            height: 300px;
            padding: 10px;
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
            border-radius: 5px;
            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>User Settings</h2>
    <!-- Form for viewing user info -->
    <form id="viewForm">
        <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="username" value="JohnDoe" readonly><br><br>
        <label for="email">Email:</label><br>
        <input type="email" id="email" value="john.doe@example.com" readonly><br><br>
    </form>

    <!-- Form for updating user info -->
    <form id="updateForm">
        <label for="newUsername">New Username:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="newUsername" value=""><br><br>
        <label for="newEmail">New Email:</label><br>
        <input type="email" id="newEmail" value=""><br><br>
        <button onclick="updateUserInfo()">Update</button>
    </form>

    <!-- Button to close the sidebar -->
    <button onclick="google.script.host.close()">Close</button>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Add JavaScript Function to Update User Info

```javascript
function updateUserInfo() {
    var newUsername = document.getElementById('newUsername').value;
    var newEmail = document.getElementById('newEmail').value;
    
    // Call Google Apps Script function to update user info
    google.script.run.updateUserInfo(newUsername, newEmail);
    
    // Clear form fields after submission
    document.getElementById('newUsername').value = '';
    document.getElementById('newEmail').value = '';
}
```

### Step 3: Create Google Apps Script Function to Update User Info

```javascript
function onOpen() {
    var html = HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Page')
        .setTitle('User Settings Sidebar');
    
    SpreadsheetApp.getUi() // Or DocumentApp or SlidesApp or FormApp.
        .showSidebar(html);
}

function updateUserInfo(newUsername, newEmail) {
    // Replace this with your actual logic to update user info in your database or spreadsheet.
    // For example:
    var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
    var sheet = spreadsheet.getActiveSheet();
    var row = 1; // Assuming the first row contains the user's info.
    
    sheet.getRange(row, 1).setValue(newUsername);
    sheet.getRange(row, 2).setValue(newEmail);
}
```

### Step 4: Open the Sidebar

In your Google Apps Script editor, add a function to open the sidebar:

```javascript
function onOpen() {
    var html = HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Page')
        .setTitle('User Settings Sidebar');
    
    SpreadsheetApp.getUi() // Or DocumentApp or SlidesApp or FormApp.
        .showSidebar(html);
}
```

This setup will create a custom sidebar with forms for updating and viewing user info. The `updateUserInfo` function in the Google Apps Script will handle the actual update logic, which you can customize as needed.
