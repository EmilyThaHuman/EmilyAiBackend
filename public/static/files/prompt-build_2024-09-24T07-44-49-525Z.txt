    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

"content": "# Creating a Data Table Component for Listing Chat Messages\n\nThe purpose of this Data Table component is to efficiently display a list of chat messages, allowing users to interact with and navigate through extensive conversations easily. It improves the overall user experience by organizing chat data in a structured and readable manner. This component leverages React's latest features for optimal performance and flexibility, providing developers with the capability to customize it according to their specific requirements.\n\n## Component Code\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst DataTable = ({ messages }) => {\n  return (\n    <table className=\"min-w-full leading-normal\">\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th className=\"px-5 py-3 border-b-2 border-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-left text-xs font-semibold text-gray-700 uppercase tracking-wider\">Sender</th>\n          <th className=\"px-5 py-3 border-b-2 border-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-left text-xs

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: 2. **Shadcn Collapsible**:
   - **Install Shadcn**: Use `npx shadcn@latest add collapsible` to add the collapsible component to your project.
   - **Import Components**: Import `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleContent`, and `CollapsibleTrigger` from `@/components/ui/collapsible`.
   - **Create Collapsible Sidebar**: Use the `Collapsible` component to create an interactive panel that expands and collapses, and customize it with themes and icons as needed.

3. **Bootstrap with Custom CSS**:
   - **Set Up Top Navigation Bar**: Use Bootstrap's predefined navbar classes to create a top navigation bar.
   - **Create Left Sidebar**: Style the left sidebar with custom CSS, ensuring it occupies a specific column (e.g., `col-2`) and includes navigation links.
   - **Customize CSS for Responsive Design**: Adjust the sidebar's collapsed state using custom CSS, ensuring it collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. Highlight active links by adding active classes to the navigation items.
3. **Bootstrap with Custom CSS**: While Bootstrap does not have a dedicated sidebar class, you can style a sidebar with custom CSS to achieve various layouts. This approach allows for the creation of a top navigation bar with a left sidebar, which can be expanded and collapsed using Bootstrap's predefined navbar classes and custom CSS. It also supports responsive design and highlighting active links.

### Implementation Steps
To create a responsive navigation bar with dropdown menus, a logo, and profile/auth UI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Design Strategy**:
   - Define the hierarchy of pages and identify the most important ones. Limit the top-level navigation to 4-7 items to keep it simple.

2. **Responsive Navbar**:
   - Use a framework like Bootstrap, which provides a responsive navbar template that can be customized for different devices. This ensures seamless navigation across devices and screen sizes.

3. **Dropdown Menus**:
   - Implement dropdown menus using Bootstrap's dropdown component. This allows for organized and structured navigation options. For example, you can use the `nav-item dropdown` class and `dropdown-menu` class to create dropdowns.

4. **Logo and Profile/Auth UI**:
   - Include the logo in the navbar and add a profile/auth UI component. This can be done by adding a `navbar-brand` for the logo and a custom link or button for the profile/auth UI.
### Implementation Steps

1. **Material UI**:
   - **Install Material UI**: If you haven't already, install Material UI using `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`.
   - **Import Components**: Import `Drawer` and `MenuItem` components from `@mui/material`.
   - **Create Sidebar**: Use the `Drawer` component to manage the sidebar, and include `MenuItem` components with icons for visual enhancement.
   - **Customize Theme**: Use PureCode AI to create a custom theme for your collapsible sidebar, setting primary and secondary colors, typography, border radius, and shadow effects as needed.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of custom user prompts for a chat app, you can use UI components like those in UI Bakery or Retool. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Using UI Bakery

1. **Add a Table Component**:
   - Click the "Add Component" button and select the "Table" component from UI Bakery.

2. **Configure Columns**:
   - Dynamic columns can be configured using JavaScript mode. Click the JS button next to the columns section to enable dynamic mode.
   - Specify columns using an array of objects, defining properties like `prop` (data property to display), `type` (available types like 'number', 'string', 'text', etc.), and `primaryKey` (at least one column must be a primary key) if necessary.
