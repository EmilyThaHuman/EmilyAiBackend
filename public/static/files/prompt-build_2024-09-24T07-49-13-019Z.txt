    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a dashboard layout for displaying your chatbot app stats with a sidebar navigation, header, and content area, consider the following structure:

### Dashboard Layout

1. **Header**
   - **Title**: "Chatbot Analytics Dashboard"
   - **Navigation Icons**: User profile, settings, help, and logout options

2. **Sidebar Navigation**
   - **Main Menu**: 
     - **Overview**
     - **Engagement**
     - **Conversions**
     - **Retention**
     - **Advanced Analytics**
   - **Submenu Options**:
     - Each main menu item can have sub-options like "Metrics," "Trends," "Reports," etc.
By following these steps, you can create a collapsible sidebar for navigation that supports expanding/collapsing submenus and highlights active links, with options for light and dark themes and icon-only or text+icon modes.

### List of Citations
2. **Shadcn Collapsible**:
   - **Install Shadcn**: Use `npx shadcn@latest add collapsible` to add the collapsible component to your project.
   - **Import Components**: Import `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleContent`, and `CollapsibleTrigger` from `@/components/ui/collapsible`.
   - **Create Collapsible Sidebar**: Use the `Collapsible` component to create an interactive panel that expands and collapses, and customize it with themes and icons as needed.

3. **Bootstrap with Custom CSS**:
   - **Set Up Top Navigation Bar**: Use Bootstrap's predefined navbar classes to create a top navigation bar.
   - **Create Left Sidebar**: Style the left sidebar with custom CSS, ensuring it occupies a specific column (e.g., `col-2`) and includes navigation links.
   - **Customize CSS for Responsive Design**: Adjust the sidebar's collapsed state using custom CSS, ensuring it collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. Highlight active links by adding active classes to the navigation items.
3. **Bootstrap with Custom CSS**: While Bootstrap does not have a dedicated sidebar class, you can style a sidebar with custom CSS to achieve various layouts. This approach allows for the creation of a top navigation bar with a left sidebar, which can be expanded and collapsed using Bootstrap's predefined navbar classes and custom CSS. It also supports responsive design and highlighting active links.

### Implementation Steps
To create a collapsible sidebar for navigation with support for expanding/collapsing submenus and highlighting active links, you can use the following components and libraries:

1. **Material UI Collapsible Sidebar**: This component from Material UI allows users to collapse and expand sidebars or navigation menus, enhancing user experience and optimizing screen space. It supports responsive design and includes features like toggle functionality and customization with themes.

2. **Shadcn Collapsible Component**: This component provides an interactive panel that expands and collapses, which can be used to create a collapsible sidebar. It includes a trigger and content sections, making it easy to implement in your project. You can customize it further with themes and icons.

               </div>
           </div>
       </div>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Custom CSS for Animations**:
   - Use CSS to animate the sidebar and make it responsive.
   - Apply transitions and animations to the sidebar.

   ```css
   /* styles.css */
   #sidebar {
       position: fixed;
       top: 0;
       left: 0;
       width: 200px;
       height: 100vh;
       background-color: #333;
       color: #fff;
       padding: 20px;
       transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
   }

   #sidebar.open {
       left: 0;
   }

   #sidebar.close {
       left: -200px;
   }

   /* Add animation for opening and closing the sidebar */
   @keyframes slideIn {
       from {
           left: -200px;
       }
       to {
           left: 0;
       }
   }

   @keyframes slideOut {
       from {
           left: 0;
       }
       to {
           left: -200px;
       }
   }

   /* Apply animation to the sidebar */
   #sidebar.open {
       animation: slideIn 0.3s ease-in-out;
   }

   #sidebar.close {
       animation: slideOut 0.3s ease-in-out;
   }
   ```

3. **JavaScript for Show/Hide Sidebar**:
   - Use JavaScript to toggle the sidebar open and close.

   ```javascript
   // Toggle sidebar open and close
   document.getElementById('toggle-sidebar').addEventListener('click', () => {
       let sidebar = document.getElementById('sidebar');
       if (sidebar.classList.contains('open')) {
           sidebar.classList.remove('open');
           sidebar.classList.add('close');
       } else {
           sidebar.classList.remove('close');
           sidebar.classList.add('open');
       }
   });
   ```
