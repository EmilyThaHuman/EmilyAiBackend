    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a prompt template editor component, you can leverage the features of tools like Portkey AI and Salesforce Prompt Builder, which offer robust capabilities for creating, managing, and deploying prompt templates. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of how you can build such a component:

1. **Use a Templating Engine**: Utilize a templating engine like Mustache, which is used by Portkey AI under the hood. Mustache allows you to define variables and incorporate them into your prompts, making them extensible.

2. **Variable Definition**: Define variables within the template that can be passed at runtime. For example, in Portkey AI, you can use `{{customer_data}}` and `{{chat_query}}` as variables.

3. **API Integration**: Integrate the prompt template editor with an API to deploy the templates seamlessly. Portkey AI allows you to create and manage prompts with just an API call.
variables: {

"customer_data":"",

"chat_query":""

}

})
```

This template can be extended with more variables and Mustache tags to enhance its functionality.

### Conclusion

By combining these features and best practices, you can create a robust prompt template editor component that supports seamless creation, management, and deployment of LLM prompts.

### References Portkey Docs: Prompt Templates Amazon Bedrock: Design a Prompt Salesforce Help: Manage Prompt Templates
6. **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create, edit, and manage prompt templates. Salesforce Prompt Builder offers features like version management, activation, and deactivation, which can be integrated into your UI.

### Example Template

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might structure a prompt template using Mustache:

```plaintext
As you can see,

`{{customer_data}}` and

`{{chat_query}}` are defined as variables in the template and you can pass their value at the runtime:

```

```javascript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

const portkey = new Portkey()

const response = portkey.prompts.completions.create({

promptID: "pp-hr-bot-5c8c6e",

variables: {

"customer_data":"",

"chat_query":""

}

})
```

This template can be extended with more variables and Mustache tags to enhance its functionality.

### Conclusion
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of custom user prompts for a chat app, you can use UI components like those in UI Bakery or Retool. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Using UI Bakery

1. **Add a Table Component**:
   - Click the "Add Component" button and select the "Table" component from UI Bakery.

2. **Configure Columns**:
   - Dynamic columns can be configured using JavaScript mode. Click the JS button next to the columns section to enable dynamic mode.
   - Specify columns using an array of objects, defining properties like `prop` (data property to display), `type` (available types like 'number', 'string', 'text', etc.), and `primaryKey` (at least one column must be a primary key) if necessary.

  USER PROMPT/QUERY: Generate an autoSuggest input compoennt for prompts

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate an auto-suggest input component for prompts, you can use the principles of prompt engineering to ensure the prompt is clear, specific, and contextual. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Clarity**: Ensure the prompt is clear and unambiguous. For example, instead of "Design an interface," say "Design a minimalistic electric car interface, focusing on sustainability aspects."

2. **Context**: Provide sufficient context to help the AI generate relevant responses. For instance, "Design a modern, user-friendly e-commerce website for a fashion brand, featuring a clean layout, easy navigation, and vibrant colors."

3. **Specificity**: Be specific about the information or format needed. For example, "Create a minimalist logo for a MedTech startup, using blue and white colors and incorporating a geometric shape."

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously test and refine prompts to improve results. Instead of saying "Suggest some fonts," say "Suggest some modern, sans-serif fonts suitable for a tech companyâ€™s website."

5. **Constraints**: Add constraints or guidelines to narrow down the AIâ€™s responses. For example, "Design a poster for a music festival, featuring vibrant colors, bold typography, and a central image of a guitar, but feel free to add other musical elements."

### Example of an Auto-Suggest Input Component

```plaintext
Auto-Suggest Input Component:
  - **Input Type**: Text
  - **Placeholder Text**: "Enter your prompt"
  - **Auto-Suggest Options**:
    1. **Clarity Check**: Ensure the prompt is clear and unambiguous.
    2. **Context Provision**: Provide sufficient context to help the AI generate relevant responses.
    3. **Specificity Enhancement**: Be specific about the information or format needed.
    4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously test and refine prompts to improve results.
    5. **Constraints Addition**: Add constraints or guidelines to narrow down the AIâ€™s responses.
```

### Implementation

To implement this in a tool like UXPin or any other design environment, you can use the following structure:

1. **Create a Form Field**:
   - Use a text input field where users can enter their prompts.

2. **Auto-Suggest Functionality**:
   - Implement auto-suggest functionality that provides suggestions based on the above criteria.
   - For example, as the user types, suggest possible completions that match the clarity, context, specificity, and constraints criteria.

3. **Dynamic Prompt Generation**:
   - Use the selected options to generate a dynamic prompt that aligns with the user's input and the suggested criteria.

4. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Provide an option for users to test and refine their prompts based on the suggested options.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive auto-suggest input component that helps users generate effective and relevant prompts for AI models.
