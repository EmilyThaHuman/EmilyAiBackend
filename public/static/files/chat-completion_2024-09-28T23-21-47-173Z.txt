It is inspired by Material Design's speed dial pattern and is ideal for applications that require an intuitive and space-efficient way for users to interact with various options.\n\n## Component Explanation\n\nThe Speed Dial component is designed to enhance user experience by consolidating multiple actions into a compact, floating action button. Upon interaction, the component reveals a set of options, each represented by an icon and an optional label. This design is particularly useful for applications with limited screen real estate and aims to provide a cleaner and more accessible user interface.\n\n## Component Design Rationale\n\n- **Space Efficiency**: Ideal for applications that need to offer multiple actions without cluttering the UI.\n- **User Friendliness**: Offers a visually appealing way for users to discover and interact with available actions.\n- **Customizability**: Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily add or remove actions and to customize the appearance to fit the application's theme.\n\n## Full React Component Code\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { FaPlus, FaEdit, FaTrash, FaTimes } from 'react-icons/fa';\n\nconst SpeedDial = () => {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  const toggle = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);\n\n  const actions = [\n    { icon: <FaPlus />, label: 'Add', onClick: () => console.log('Add action') },\n    { icon: <FaEdit />, label: 'Edit', onClick: () => console.log('Edit action') },\n    { icon: <FaTrash />, label: 'Delete', onClick: () => console.log('Delete action') }\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div className='relative'>\n      <button onClick={toggle} className='p-2 rounded-full bg-blue-500 text-white'>\n        {isOpen ? <FaTimes /> : <FaPlus />}\n      </button>\n      <div className={`absolute right-0 ${isOpen ? 'flex' : 'hidden'} flex-col`}> \n        {actions.map((action, index) => (\n          <button key={index} className='m-1 p-2 rounded-lg bg-gray-200 text-black' onClick={action.onClick}>\n            {action.icon}\n            {action.label && <span className='ml-2'>{action.label}</span>}\n          </button>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default SpeedDial;\n```\n\n## Usage And Customization\n\nThe SpeedDial component can be included in any React application by importing and inserting it where needed. Its `actions` array is easily customizable, allowing developers to add, remove, or reorder actions as required. The visual style can also be adapted using CSS or Tailwind classes to match the application's design.\n\n## References\n\n- Material Design Guidelines: Speed Dial Pattern (https://material.io/components/buttons-floating-action-button#types-of-transitions)\n"}
