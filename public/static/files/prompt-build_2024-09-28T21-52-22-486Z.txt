    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices – be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a data table component for organizing styles, themes, and animations for each workspace in your project, you can use a combination of the features from various table components. Here’s a suggested approach:

1. **Grafana Table Visualization**:
   - Use Grafana's table visualization to display data in a flexible and customizable manner. You can add columns for styles, themes, and animations and use field overrides to customize the display of each column.
   - For example, you could have columns like "Style", "Theme", "Animation", and add custom cell data rendering to show detailed information about each style and theme.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data related to UI components, you can use the following guidelines and example code from the provided sources:

### Key Components and Features

1. **Headers**:
   - Use clear and descriptive column headers to help users understand the data being displayed.

2. **Rows and Cells**:
   - Ensure each row and cell is well-defined and easy to read. Use proper formatting and ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.

3. **Pagination**:
   - Implement pagination to handle large datasets effectively. This helps in splitting the data into manageable pages.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filtering and sorting features to allow users to quickly find specific data. This can be achieved through dropdown menus or search bars.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database for managing project AI vectors, you can use the Mantine DataTable component from the Mantine UI library. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. **Install Mantine DataTable**:
   ```bash
   npm i mantine-datatable
   ```

2. **Import and Set Up the Component**:
   ```javascript
   import { Box } from '@mantine/core';
   import { showNotification } from '@mantine/notifications';
   import { DataTable } from 'mantine-datatable';

   export function GettingStartedExample() {
     const data = [
       { id: 1, name: 'AI Vector 1', vectorType: 'Text Embedding' },
       { id: 2, name: 'AI Vector 2', vectorType: 'Image Embedding' },
       // More records...
     ];

     const columns = [
       { accessor: 'id', title: '#', textAlign: 'right' },
       { accessor: 'name' },
       { accessor: 'vectorType' },
     ];
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data upserted into a vector database for AI project management, you can use a UI library that supports advanced table features such as asynchronous data loading, pagination, column sorting, and custom cell data rendering. Here’s a step-by-step guide using Mantine UI and its `mantine-datatable` package:

1. **Install Mantine and mantine-datatable**:
   ```bash
   npm i @mantine/core mantine-datatable
   ```

2. **Import the necessary components**:
   ```javascript
   import { Box } from '@mantine/core';
   import { showNotification } from '@mantine/notifications';
   import { DataTable } from 'mantine-datatable';
   ```
To generate a data table component for code tools, you can use the following approaches:

1. **UiPath**: You can use UiPath to generate a data table from unstructured data. The process involves using the Screen Scraping Wizard to extract data and then using the Generate Data Table activity to create a table from the scraped data.

2. **Form.io**: Form.io provides a Data Grid component that allows you to add multiple rows of field groupings. This can be used to create a structured data table by defining key-value pairs and customizing the grid's behavior.

3. **Commercetools UIKit**: This library provides a DataTable component that can render tabular data. You need to define the `rows` and `columns` lists as arrays of objects, where each column object has a unique `key` and a `label` for the header.
