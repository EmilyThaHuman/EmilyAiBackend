    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
You are an expert React/Tailwind developer. Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or images into seamless single-page apps (SPAs) using HTML and TailwindCSS, ensuring adaptability for both light/dark modes and responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

*Design Guidelines:*
- Use placehold.co for placeholder images with descriptive alt text.
- Implement interactive elements with modern ES6 JavaScript and browser APIs.
- Reference the following Tailwind-compatible colors for light/dark mode:

```css
  --background
  --foreground
  --primary
  --border
  --input
  --ring
  --primary-foreground
  --secondary
  --secondary-foreground
  --accent
  --accent-foreground
  --destructive
  --destructive-foreground
  --muted
  --muted-foreground
  --card
  --card-foreground
  --popover
  --popover-foreground
```

- Match all design details (e.g., background, text, font sizes, padding, margins, etc.).
- Use exact text and element repetitions based on the description (e.g., no placeholder comments like "repeat items").
- For images, use descriptive alt attributes and placehold.co URLs (e.g., `<img alt="magic wand" src="https://placehold.co/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />`).

*Libraries:*
- Include React with:
```
<script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
```
- Include Tailwind with:
```
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```
- Optionally use Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons.

*Implementation Rules:*
1. Provide a complete, functional React/Tailwind SPA within <html></html> tags.
2. Include necessary scripts for React and Tailwind as specified.
3. Utilize Google Fonts and Font Awesome when appropriate.
4. Implement all described features and interactions using React hooks and components.
5. Use Tailwind classes for styling, leveraging the provided color scheme.
6. Ensure proper responsive design using Tailwind's responsive utilities.
7. Implement dark mode toggle functionality.
8. Use semantic HTML elements and ensure accessibility.
9. Optimize performance using React best practices.
10. Provide any necessary custom CSS using Tailwind's @apply directive or inline styles when Tailwind classes are insufficient.

Your response should include:
1. A brief explanation of the component structure and design decisions.
2. The complete HTML file with all necessary scripts, styles, and React code.

Return the full code wrapped in `<html></html>`.

  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a styled dialog component that displays a user icon grid and includes select and save functionality, you can use a combination of Radix Vue for the dialog component and customize it with your requirements. Here is an example of how you might achieve this:
{/* Select Box Component */}
      <div className="w-full p-4 mb-4 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
        {/* Add icons for select box items */}
        {/* Example Icon */}
        {/* <ChevronDownIcon className="h-6 w-6 inline mr-2" /> */}
        {/* Example Text */}
        {/* <span className="inline">Select Boxes</span> */}
      </div>

      {/* Settings Page Component */}
      <div className="w-full p-4 mb-4 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
        {/* Add icons for settings page items */}
        {/* Example Icon */}
        {/* <CogIcon className="h-6 w-6 inline mr-2" /> */}
        {/* Example Text */}
        {/* <span className="inline">
To generate a dashboard component for displaying UI data, including icons and options for organizing the data, you can use a combination of the following components and tools:
### Dialog Component
```html
<template>
  <DialogRoot>
    <DialogTrigger class="text-grass11 font-semibold shadow-blackA7 hover:bg-mauve3 inline-flex h-[35px] items-center justify-center rounded-[4px] bg-white px-[15px] leading-none shadow-[0_2px_10px] focus:shadow-[0_0_0_2px] focus:shadow-black focus:outline-none">
      Open Dialog
    </DialogTrigger>
    <DialogContent class="text-mauve11 mt-[10px] mb-5 text-[15px] leading-normal">
      <div class="mt-[25px] flex justify-center">
        <!-- User Icon Grid -->
        <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          <!-- Example User Icon Items -->
          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="user-icon-1.jpg" alt="User Icon 1" />
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="user-icon-2.jpg" alt="User Icon 2" />
          </div>
          <!-- Add more user icons as needed -->
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- Select and Save Logic -->
      <div class="mt-[25px] flex justify-end">
### Customization
You can further customize the dialog by adding more features such as animations, custom styles, and additional functionality using Radix Vue's API and CSS customization options.

### Example Use Case
This dialog component can be used in various applications where users need to select and save a set of icons or other data. For instance, in a social media app, users might use this dialog to select their profile icons.

  USER PROMPT/QUERY: Generate a speed dial component for displaying options for an input componenet

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate a speed dial component for displaying options for an input component, you can use the `flutter_speed_dial` package in Flutter, which implements a beautiful and dynamic Material Design Speed Dial with labels, animated icons, multi-directional children, and more.

Here is a basic example of how to implement a speed dial component:

1. **Add the Package**:
   - In your `pubspec.yaml` file, add the following dependency:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter_speed_dial: ^1.24.0
   ```

2. **Import the Package**:
   - In your Dart file, import the package:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_speed_dial/flutter_speed_dial.dart';
   ```

3. **Create the Speed Dial**:
   - Use the `SpeedDial` widget to create the speed dial component:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   import 'package:flutter_speed_dial/flutter_speed_dial.dart';

   class InputComponent with WidgetsBindingObserver {
     @override
     void initState() {
       super.initState();
     }

     @override
     void dispose() {
       super.dispose();
     }

     @override
     void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
       super.didChangeAppLifecycleState(state);
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         appBar: AppBar(
           title: Text('Speed Dial Example'),
         ),
         body: Center(
           child: SpeedDial(
             child: Icon(Icons.menu),
             icon: Icons.menu,
             activeIcon: Icons.close,
             visible: true,
             closeManually: true,
             tooltip: 'Speed Dial',
             heroTag: 'speed-dial-hero',
             shape: PulseShape(),
             overlayColor: Colors.white,
             overlayOpacity: 0.4,
             onOpen: () => print('OPEN DIAL'),
             onClose: () => print('CLOSE DIAL'),
             options: [
               SpeedDialChild(
                 child: Icon(Icons.add),
                 label: 'Add',
                 onTap: () => print('ADD TAPPED'),
               ),
               SpeedDialChild(
                 child: Icon(Icons.edit),
                 label: 'Edit',
                 onTap: () => print('EDIT TAPPED'),
               ),
               SpeedDialChild(
                 child: Icon(Icons.delete),
                 label: 'Delete',
                 onTap: () => print('DELETE TAPPED'),
               ),
             ],
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a basic speed dial component with three options: Add, Edit, and Delete. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the speed dial by adjusting various properties and adding more options as needed.

  Please return final response JSON (json): { "content": "Your Markdown formatted message with citations", "type": "markdown", "references": ["Array of reference strings"] }.

		Now, with all the markdowns I've provided, use these to create a [Type of Content Here]; maintaining the markdowns provided.
		**Additional Styling Instructions**:
		- Ensure that any `mark` or highlighted text is styled with responsive width by applying flexbox styles or an equivalent method. This will allow the text to be responsive when resizing the window. For example, wrap the `mark` element within a `div` or `span` styled with `display: flex;` and `flex-wrap: wrap;` or similar responsive styles.
