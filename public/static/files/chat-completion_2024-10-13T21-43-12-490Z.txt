    <h1>React Input Component with Automatic Text Animation</h1>

<h2>Component Purpose and Design Rationale</h2>

<p>The purpose of this component is to enhance user interaction by introducing automatic text animation within an input field. This animation can serve as a visual cue or feedback mechanism, especially useful in scenarios where user engagement is critical, such as in forms or search fields. The design rationale behind this component is to leverage the simplicity of React's state management alongside CSS animations to create a seamless and engaging user experience without relying on complex animation libraries.</p>
