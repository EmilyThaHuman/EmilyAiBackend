    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

To generate a prompt template editor component, you can leverage the features of tools like Portkey AI and Salesforce Prompt Builder, which offer robust capabilities for creating, managing, and deploying prompt templates. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of how you can build such a component:

1. **Use a Templating Engine**: Utilize a templating engine like Mustache, which is used by Portkey AI under the hood. Mustache allows you to define variables and incorporate them into your prompts, making them extensible.

2. **Variable Definition**: Define variables within the template that can be passed at runtime. For example, in Portkey AI, you can use `{{customer_data}}` and `{{chat_query}}` as variables.

3. **API Integration**: Integrate the prompt template editor with an API to deploy the templates seamlessly. Portkey AI allows you to create and manage prompts with just an API call.
6. **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create, edit, and manage prompt templates. Salesforce Prompt Builder offers features like version management, activation, and deactivation, which can be integrated into your UI.

### Example Template

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might structure a prompt template using Mustache:

```plaintext
As you can see,

`{{customer_data}}` and

`{{chat_query}}` are defined as variables in the template and you can pass their value at the runtime:

```

```javascript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

const portkey = new Portkey()

const response = portkey.prompts.completions.create({

promptID: "pp-hr-bot-5c8c6e",

variables: {

"customer_data":"",

"chat_query":""

}

})
```

This template can be extended with more variables and Mustache tags to enhance its functionality.

### Conclusion
To generate code for a responsive sidebar template using Bootstrap, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up the project structure**:
   - Create an HTML file and link the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Use the container class to create a fixed-width layout for the content.
   - Implement the grid system to organize content into rows and columns.

2. **Create the sidebar structure**:
   - Use Bootstrap's navbar component for the navigation bar.
   - Utilize the `navbar` and `navbar-expand` classes for responsiveness.
   - Add a sidebar container with a fixed width using the `col` classes.
