    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.
	

    ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS: When responding to queries about React:
      1. Analyze the request carefully, considering the component's purpose, potential variations, and use cases.

      2. Provide a comprehensive solution that includes:
         - A brief explanation of the component's design rationale
         - The full styled-component code, utilizing advanced features when appropriate

      3. Utilize advanced styled-components features such as:
         - Theming and global styles
         - CSS prop for dynamic styling
         - attrs constructor for default props and HTML attributes
         - as prop for polymorphic components
         - keyframes for animations
         - createGlobalStyle for global CSS
         - css helper for reusable CSS snippets
         - styled function for extending existing components

      4. Incorporate modern CSS techniques like:
         - CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
         - CSS Custom Properties (variables) for theming
         - CSS Modules for local scoping when appropriate
         - Media queries for responsive design
         - CSS-in-JS techniques for dynamic styling based on props or state

      5. Optimize for performance by:
         - Using memoization techniques (React.memo, useMemo) when appropriate
         - Leveraging CSS containment for improved rendering performance
         - Implementing code-splitting for larger component libraries
         - Utilizing React.lazy for lazy loading components when needed
         - Avoiding unnecessary re-renders with React.memo or useMemo
         - Utilizing CSS-in-JS techniques for dynamic styling based on props or state

      6. Ensure code quality by:
         - Following React and styled-components best practices
         - Using consistent naming conventions

      8. Always format your response using Markdown syntax.
      Use appropriate formatting for headings, text styling, lists, code blocks, and other elements as needed.
      Here's a quick reference:

         ---

      # Heading 1
      ## Heading 2

To generate a styled dialog component that displays a user icon grid and includes select and save functionality, you can use a combination of Radix Vue for the dialog component and customize it with your requirements. Here is an example of how you might achieve this:
To generate a reusable styled button component in React, you can use Styled Components. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Styled Components**:
   ```bash
   npm install styled-components
   ```

2. **Create the Button Component**:
   ```javascript
   // Button.js
   import styled from 'styled-components';

   const Button = styled.button`
     background: ${(props) => (props.filled ? "gray" : "transparent")};
     border-radius: 3px;
     color: ${(props) => (props.filled ? "white" : "black")};
     border: 1px solid;
     display: inline-block;
     margin: 0.5em 1em;
     padding: 0.5em 0;
     transition: color .25s ease;
     cursor: pointer;
     &:hover{
       color: ${(props) => (props.filled ? "blue" : "red")};
     }
   `;

   export default Button;
   ```

3. **Use the Button Component in Your App**:
   ```javascript
   // App.js
   import React from 'react';
   import Button from './Button';
To generate a file manager component with a dark theme, you can follow these steps:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Create the basic structure of the file manager using HTML. This will include elements like navigation, file list, and any other necessary components.

   ```html
   <html lang="en" class="dark">
   <body>
     <!-- Navigation Bar -->
     <nav class="nav-bar">
       <button class="toggle-theme">Toggle Theme</button>
     </nav>

     <!-- File List -->
     <div class="file-list">
       <ul>
         <!-- File List Items -->
         <li class="file-item">File 1</li>
         <li class="file-item">File 2</li>
         <!-- More files -->
       </ul>
     </div>

     <!-- Footer -->
     <footer class="footer">
       <!-- Footer Content -->
     </footer>

     <!-- JavaScript for theme toggle and other functionality -->
     <script src="script.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
### Custom Styling
Customize the button's appearance by adding more CSS styles, such as background color, text color, padding, borders, etc.

This approach ensures that the button appears when the user scrolls down a certain distance and smoothly scrolls the page back to the top when clicked.

  RESULTS: To generate a styled file upload button with a file preview option, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide using Bootstrap for styling and a simple JavaScript library for previewing the files:

### Step 1: Create the HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styled File Upload</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/file-upload-with-preview/dist/style.css">
</head>
<body>

<div class="container mt-5">
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-header">Styled File Upload</div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <input type="file" id="fileInput" multiple accept="image/*" />
                    <div id="filePreview" class="mt-3"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/file-upload-with-preview/dist/index.js"></script>
<script>
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
    const filePreview = document.getElementById('filePreview');
    
    const upload = new FileUploadWithPreview('fileInput');

    fileInput.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
        const files = e.target.files;
        if (files.length > 0) {
            // Clear previous preview
            filePreview.innerHTML = '';
            
            // Create preview for each file
            files.forEach((file) => {
                const preview = document.createElement('div');
                preview.className = 'preview';
                const reader = new FileReader();
                reader.onload = (event) => {
                    const img = document.createElement('img');
                    img.src = event.target.result;
                    preview.appendChild(img);
                };
                reader.readAsDataURL(file);
                filePreview.appendChild(preview);
            });
        }
    });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Customize the CSS (Optional)

You can customize the appearance of the file upload button and the file preview by adding custom CSS.

```css
.preview {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.preview img {
    width: 100px;
    height: auto;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **HTML Structure**: The input field `fileInput` is used to select files. The `#filePreview` div is where the preview images will be displayed.
2. **JavaScript**: When the input field changes, it initializes the `FileUploadWithPreview` object and listens for changes to the input field. It then creates a preview for each selected file by reading the file as a data URL and appending it to the preview div.
3. **CSS**: Optional custom styles are added to enhance the appearance of the preview images.

This approach uses Bootstrap for basic styling and the `file-upload-with-preview` library for handling and displaying the file previews.
