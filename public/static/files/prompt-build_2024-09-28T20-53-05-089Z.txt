    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices – be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database for managing project AI vectors, you can use the Mantine DataTable component from the Mantine UI library. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. **Install Mantine DataTable**:
   ```bash
   npm i mantine-datatable
   ```

2. **Import and Set Up the Component**:
   ```javascript
   import { Box } from '@mantine/core';
   import { showNotification } from '@mantine/notifications';
   import { DataTable } from 'mantine-datatable';

   export function GettingStartedExample() {
     const data = [
       { id: 1, name: 'AI Vector 1', vectorType: 'Text Embedding' },
       { id: 2, name: 'AI Vector 2', vectorType: 'Image Embedding' },
       // More records...
     ];

     const columns = [
       { accessor: 'id', title: '#', textAlign: 'right' },
       { accessor: 'name' },
       { accessor: 'vectorType' },
     ];
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database for projects, you can utilize various UI libraries that offer robust table components. Here are some options and their key features:

1. **Frames X Design System**:
   - **Features**: Provides over 20K components in 80+ different interface categories, including two structure variants for tables with row and column-based approaches. It offers customization options and can be used to create tables with customizable cells.

2. **React Data Table Component**:
   - **Features**: Includes built-in sorting, pagination, selectable rows, expandable rows, and customizable styling. It is responsive and themeable, making it suitable for dynamic data presentation.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database, you can use the `MaterialReactTable` component from the `material-react-table` library, which is built on top of TanStack Table and integrates well with Material UI. Here’s a concise example of how to implement it:

1. **Install the library**: 
   ```bash
   npm install material-react-table
   ```

2. **Import necessary components**:
   ```javascript
   import { useMemo } from 'react';
   import { MaterialReactTable, useMaterialReactTable, type MRT_ColumnDef } from 'material-react-table';
   ```

3. **Define the data structure**:
   ```javascript
   type Person = {
     name: { firstName: string; lastName: string; },
     address: string,
     city: string,
     state: string,
   };
To generate a data table component for a vector database list, you can use the following steps:

1. **Create a Vector Search Index**: Use a tool like Databricks' Mosaic AI Vector Search to create a vector search index from a Delta table. This index will include embedded data with metadata, allowing for efficient similarity searches.

2. **Choose the Embedding Method**: Decide how to provide vector embeddings. You can either have Databricks compute the embeddings or use pre-calculated embeddings from your Delta table.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data related to UI components, you can use the following guidelines and example code from the provided sources:

### Key Components and Features

1. **Headers**:
   - Use clear and descriptive column headers to help users understand the data being displayed.

2. **Rows and Cells**:
   - Ensure each row and cell is well-defined and easy to read. Use proper formatting and ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.

3. **Pagination**:
   - Implement pagination to handle large datasets effectively. This helps in splitting the data into manageable pages.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filtering and sorting features to allow users to quickly find specific data. This can be achieved through dropdown menus or search bars.

  RESULTS: To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database for managing project AI vectors, you can use the Mantine DataTable component from the Mantine UI library. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. **Install Mantine DataTable**:
   ```bash
   npm i mantine-datatable
   ```

2. **Import and Set Up the Component**:
   ```javascript
   import { Box } from '@mantine/core';
   import { showNotification } from '@mantine/notifications';
   import { DataTable } from 'mantine-datatable';

   export function GettingStartedExample() {
     const data = [
       { id: 1, name: 'AI Vector 1', vectorType: 'Text Embedding' },
       { id: 2, name: 'AI Vector 2', vectorType: 'Image Embedding' },
       // More records...
     ];

     const columns = [
       { accessor: 'id', title: '#', textAlign: 'right' },
       { accessor: 'name' },
       { accessor: 'vectorType' },
     ];

     return (
       <DataTable
         withTableBorder
         borderRadius="sm"
         withColumnBorders
         striped
         highlightOnHover
         data={data}
         columns={columns}
         onRowClick={({ record }) => showNotification({
           title: `Clicked on ${record.name}`,
           message: `You clicked on ${record.name}, a ${record.vectorType} vector`,
           withBorder: true,
         })}
       />
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Customize the Table as Needed**:
   - **Asynchronous Data Loading**: If your data is fetched asynchronously, you can use the `onLoad` prop to handle loading indicators.
   - **Pagination**: Add pagination support using the `pagination` prop.
   - **Sorting and Custom Cell Rendering**: Use the `sort` and `render` props for column sorting and custom cell data rendering, respectively.

This setup provides a lightweight, customizable, and dark-theme aware table component that fits well with your requirements for managing project AI vectors.

### Additional Considerations
- **Customization**: Mantine DataTable is fully customizable, allowing you to tailor the look and feel of the table to your project's needs.
- **Features**: It supports asynchronous data loading, pagination, column sorting, custom cell data rendering, and more.

### Example Use Case
```javascript
// Example usage with custom cell rendering and onRowClick event handling

import { Box } from '@mantine/core';
import { showNotification } from '@mantine/notifications';
import { DataTable } from 'mantine-datatable';

export function CustomDataTableExample() {
  const data = [
    { id: 1, name: 'AI Vector 1', vectorType: 'Text Embedding' },
    { id: 2, name: 'AI Vector 2', vectorType: 'Image Embedding' },
    // More records...
  ];

  const columns = [
    { accessor: 'id', title: '#', textAlign: 'right' },
    { accessor: 'name' },
    {
      accessor: 'vectorType',
      render: ({ vectorType }) => (
        <Box fw={700} c={vectorType === 'Text Embedding' ? 'blue' : 'red'}>
          {vectorType.slice(0, 3).toUpperCase()}
        </Box>
      ),
    },
  ];

  return (
    <DataTable
      withTableBorder
      borderRadius="sm"
      withColumnBorders
      striped
      highlightOnHover
      data={data}
      columns={columns}
      onRowClick={({ record }) => showNotification({
        title: `Clicked on ${record.name}`,
        message: `You clicked on ${record.name}, a ${record.vectorType} vector`,
        withBorder: true,
      })}
    />
  );
}
```

This example demonstrates how to use Mantine DataTable with custom cell rendering and an onRowClick event handler to manage project AI vectors effectively.
