    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To create a responsive navigation bar that adjusts based on screen size, you can use the following steps and techniques:

### Using Framer
1. **Create Basic Components**:
   - Create a logo and hamburger menu components that will reside inside the navbar.

2. **Create Navbar Base**:
   - Design the navbar as a fixed-height, horizontally stacked container with three parts. This will be the base for both desktop and mobile views.

3. **Add Content Inside Skeleton**:
   - Ensure the logo container includes both the logo and the hamburger menu. This is crucial for making the navbar responsive.

4. **Create Mobile Variants**:
   - Create mobile variants for both closed and open states. Vertically stack the parent container, set all children layers to fill width and height, and adjust spacing for the logo container.

5. **Add Transitions**:
   - Add "on click" connections to the menu icons for both closed and open variants.
5. **Add Transitions**:
   - Add "on click" connections to the menu icons for both closed and open variants.

6. **Clean Up & Add to Page**:
   - Add the component to your page, set the width to 100%, and position as fixed. Adjust the mobile logo variant to just the icon for cleaner design.

### Using ReactJS
1. **Create Responsive Navbar Component**:
   - Use a `useMediaQuery` hook to make the navbar responsive. This hook allows you to conditionally render components based on screen sizes.

2. **Mobile Screen Design**:
   - On mobile screens, use a hamburger icon that toggles the nav links. Implement a state and toggle function to manage this behavior.

3. **CSS for Responsive Navbar**:
   - Use CSS to change the display property based on screen width. For example, set `display: none` or `block` at desired widths to make the navbar responsive.

### Using Bootstrap
1. **Bootstrap Navbar Template**:
   - Use Bootstrap's navbar template, which is designed to be fully responsive. This ensures seamless navigation across devices and screen sizes.
   
2. **Customize Navbar**:
   - Use Bootstrap's classes and components to customize the navbar. For example, add a max-width to the container to ensure navbar elements do not exceed a certain size.
   
3. **Hamburger Button**:
   - Use the `navbar-toggler` button to toggle the navbar on smaller screens. This button includes a `navbar-toggler-icon` that changes the navbar's layout when clicked.

### Functions and Styles
1. **Active Link Highlighting**:
   - Use CSS or React to highlight active links. For example, add a class like `.active` and style it accordingly.

   - **Import Components**: Import `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleContent`, and `CollapsibleTrigger` from `@/components/ui/collapsible`.
   - **Create Collapsible Sidebar**: Use the `Collapsible` component to create an interactive panel that expands and collapses, and customize it with themes and icons as needed.

3. **Bootstrap with Custom CSS**:
   - **Set Up Top Navigation Bar**: Use Bootstrap's predefined navbar classes to create a top navigation bar.
   - **Create Left Sidebar**: Style the left sidebar with custom CSS, ensuring it occupies a specific column (e.g., `col-2`) and includes navigation links.
   - **Customize CSS for Responsive Design**: Adjust the sidebar's collapsed state using custom CSS, ensuring it collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. Highlight active links by adding active classes to the navigation items.
