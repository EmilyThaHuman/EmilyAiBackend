    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices – be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database for an AI VDB project, you can use a combination of UI libraries and frameworks that support filtering, sorting, and customization. Here’s a suggested approach:

1. **Choose a UI Library**:
   - **TanStack Table (formerly React Table)**: A lightweight, headless UI library that provides extensive control over table components and is compatible with Material UI.
   - **Mantine DataTable**: A lightweight, dependency-free table component for Mantine UI applications, featuring asynchronous data loading and customization options.

2. **Customize the Table**:
   - Use the chosen library to create a table component with necessary features like filtering, sorting, and column customization.
   - For example, you can use TanStack Table with Material UI components to build a powerful and customizable table.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database for projects, you can utilize various UI libraries that offer robust table components. Here are some options and their key features:

1. **Frames X Design System**:
   - **Features**: Provides over 20K components in 80+ different interface categories, including two structure variants for tables with row and column-based approaches. It offers customization options and can be used to create tables with customizable cells.

2. **React Data Table Component**:
   - **Features**: Includes built-in sorting, pagination, selectable rows, expandable rows, and customizable styling. It is responsive and themeable, making it suitable for dynamic data presentation.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database, you can use the `MaterialReactTable` component from the `material-react-table` library, which is built on top of TanStack Table and integrates well with Material UI. Here’s a concise example of how to implement it:

1. **Install the library**: 
   ```bash
   npm install material-react-table
   ```

2. **Import necessary components**:
   ```javascript
   import { useMemo } from 'react';
   import { MaterialReactTable, useMaterialReactTable, type MRT_ColumnDef } from 'material-react-table';
   ```

3. **Define the data structure**:
   ```javascript
   type Person = {
     name: { firstName: string; lastName: string; },
     address: string,
     city: string,
     state: string,
   };
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database for managing project AI vectors, you can use the Mantine DataTable component from the Mantine UI library. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. **Install Mantine DataTable**:
   ```bash
   npm i mantine-datatable
   ```

2. **Import and Set Up the Component**:
   ```javascript
   import { Box } from '@mantine/core';
   import { showNotification } from '@mantine/notifications';
   import { DataTable } from 'mantine-datatable';

   export function GettingStartedExample() {
     const data = [
       { id: 1, name: 'AI Vector 1', vectorType: 'Text Embedding' },
       { id: 2, name: 'AI Vector 2', vectorType: 'Image Embedding' },
       // More records...
     ];

     const columns = [
       { accessor: 'id', title: '#', textAlign: 'right' },
       { accessor: 'name' },
       { accessor: 'vectorType' },
     ];
To generate a data table component for a vector database list, you can use the following steps:

1. **Create a Vector Search Index**: Use a tool like Databricks' Mosaic AI Vector Search to create a vector search index from a Delta table. This index will include embedded data with metadata, allowing for efficient similarity searches.

2. **Choose the Embedding Method**: Decide how to provide vector embeddings. You can either have Databricks compute the embeddings or use pre-calculated embeddings from your Delta table.

### Using Material React Table

1. **Pre-built Component**: Use the `<MaterialReactTable />` component for a pre-built single component data grid.
2. **Customization**: Alternatively, use the `useMaterialReactTable` hook to build your own markup from scratch, allowing for total control over customization.
3. **Features**: Include features like sorting, pagination, and custom cell data rendering to suit your needs.

### Using Mantine DataTable

1. **Lightweight and Customizable**: Use Mantine DataTable for its lightweight, dependency-free nature and full customization capabilities.
2. **Features**: Include features like asynchronous data loading, pagination, column sorting, and custom cell data rendering.
3. **Integration with Mantine UI**: Ensure it fits seamlessly with your Mantine UI application, making it easy to integrate and customize.

### Example Implementation

Here’s a simplified example using Material React Table:

```javascript
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import { MaterialReactTable, useMaterialReactTable } from 'material-react-table';

// Example data type
type Person = {
  name: { firstName: string; lastName: string };
  address: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
};

// Nested data is okay; see accessorKeys in ColumnDef below
const data: Person[] = [
  {
    name: { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' },
    address: '261 Erdman Ford',
    city: 'East Daphne',
    state: 'Kentucky'
  },
  // More records...
];

const table = useMaterialReactTable({
  columns,
  data // data must be memoized or stable (useState, useMemo, defined outside of this component, etc.)
});

return (
  <MaterialReactTable table={table} />
);
```

### Summary

- **Frames X Design System**: Offers a versatile Table component with customization options.
- **Material React Table**: Provides a pre-built component with extensive customization capabilities.
- **Mantine DataTable**: A lightweight, customizable table component suitable for Mantine UI applications.

Each library has its strengths, and choosing the right one depends on your specific requirements and the ecosystem you are working within.
