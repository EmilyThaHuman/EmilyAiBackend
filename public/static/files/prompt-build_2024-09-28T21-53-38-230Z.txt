    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices – be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

   - Set the Triggered Event to match the Data Source event, for example, 'populateState'.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of chatbot settings, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Table Schema**:
   - Identify the key settings for your chatbot, such as goal, tone, message length, and triggers.
   - Create a table with columns for each setting, ensuring the data types are appropriate (e.g., text, boolean, integer).

2. **Populate the Table**:
   - Use an API or a data source to fetch the chatbot settings and populate the table.
   - Ensure the data is structured and can be easily updated or refreshed.

3. **Configure the Data Table Component**:
   - Use a UI framework like Form.io or Power Apps to create a data table component.
   - Configure the component to display the chatbot settings in a table format, allowing for sorting, filtering, and customization as needed.

### Example Using Form.io
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of custom user prompts for a chat app, you can use UI components like those in UI Bakery or Retool. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Using UI Bakery

1. **Add a Table Component**:
   - Click the "Add Component" button and select the "Table" component from UI Bakery.

2. **Configure Columns**:
   - Dynamic columns can be configured using JavaScript mode. Click the JS button next to the columns section to enable dynamic mode.
   - Specify columns using an array of objects, defining properties like `prop` (data property to display), `type` (available types like 'number', 'string', 'text', etc.), and `primaryKey` (at least one column must be a primary key) if necessary.
To generate a data table component for listing chat messages, you can follow these steps using UI Bakery:

1. **Create the Table Component**:
   - Add a table component to your UI Bakery project.
   - Connect your data source to the table by clicking the **Connect my data** button in the **Data** field of the table.

2. **Set Up Columns**:
   - Add columns for each piece of information you want to display, such as `id`, `sender`, `receiver`, and `text`.

3. **Customize Column Types**:
   - Set the type of each column according to the data type. For example, set `sender` and `receiver` to `Link` if you want to display user profiles, and set `text` to `String`.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filters to narrow down the data if necessary. For example, you can create a filter to show messages between specific users.

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate a data table to display UI component data for a chatbot app, you can use a JavaScript DataGrid like DHTMLX Grid. Here’s a step-by-step guide to integrate it into your chatbot app:

1. **Choose DHTMLX Grid**:
   - Select DHTMLX Grid for its customizable and fast performance capabilities, which are essential for handling large data sets in a chatbot app.

2. **Customize the Grid**:
   - Add filters and sorting features to the grid to enhance user interaction.
   - Use the grid's rich API to customize elements such as column widths, row freezing, and adding custom HTML to cells.

3. **Integrate with Your Chatbot App**:
   - Use the grid's flexible customization via CSS to style the grid according to your UI design.
   - Integrate the grid into your chatbot app using frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js, as DHTMLX provides code examples for these frameworks.

4. **Example Configuration**:
   - **Grid Configuration**:
     ```json
     {
       "label": "Data Grid",
       "persistent": "client-only",
       "trigger": {
         "init": false,
         "server": false
       },
       "refreshOn": "populate",
       "event": "fetchMe",
       "dataSrc": "url",
       "fetch": {
         "url": "https://myurl.json",
         "method": "get",
         "headers": [],
         "mapFunction": "",
         "forwardHeaders": false,
         "authenticate": false
       },
       "allowCaching": true,
       "key": "dataGrid",
       "type": "datagrid",
       "input": true,
       "tableView": false
     }
     ```
   - **Populate Data**:
     - Set up a Data Source component to fetch data from an external URL and populate the Data Grid with the fetched data.

5. **Example Usage**:
   - Create a chatbot interface with a Data Grid component displaying UI component data.
   - Add buttons and text fields to interact with the chatbot and display the fetched data in the grid.

### Data Table Example

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Component ID | Unique identifier for the UI component |
| Component Type | Type of the UI component (e.g., button, text field) |
| Component Properties | Properties of the UI component (e.g., color, size) |
| Component Data | Data associated with the UI component |

### Integration Example

1. **HTML**:
    ```html
    <div id="grid-container"></div>
    ```

2. **JavaScript**:
    ```javascript
    // Initialize the DHTMLX Grid
    var myGrid = new dhtmlXGridObject('grid-container');
    
    // Define the columns
    myGrid.setColumnId(0, 'Component ID');
    myGrid.setColumnId(1, 'Component Type');
    myGrid.setColumnId(2, 'Component Properties');
    myGrid.setColumnId(3, 'Component Data');
    
    // Set the data source URL
    myGrid.setURL('https://myurl.json');
    
    // Load the data into the grid
    myGrid.load();
    
    // Customize the grid appearance and behavior as needed
    myGrid.setSkin('material');
    ```

This approach will help you create a dynamic data table to display UI component data within your chatbot app, ensuring it is customizable and user-friendly.
