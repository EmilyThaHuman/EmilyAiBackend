    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices â€“ be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ðŸª„" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a data table component for organizing a list of custom user prompts for a chat app, you can use UI components like those in UI Bakery or Retool. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Using UI Bakery

1. **Add a Table Component**:
   - Click the "Add Component" button and select the "Table" component from UI Bakery.

2. **Configure Columns**:
   - Dynamic columns can be configured using JavaScript mode. Click the JS button next to the columns section to enable dynamic mode.
   - Specify columns using an array of objects, defining properties like `prop` (data property to display), `type` (available types like 'number', 'string', 'text', etc.), and `primaryKey` (at least one column must be a primary key) if necessary.
To generate a data table component for organizing chatbot session data, you can use a combination of properties and attributes from various chatbot platforms and frameworks. Here is a sample data table component that includes relevant fields for organizing chatbot session data:
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of chat bot UI data, you can use a tool like Form.io, which provides a Data Table as a Select Component. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to create such a component:

1. **Add the Data Source Component**:
   - Start by adding the Data Source component to the builder.
   - Within the settings, click the **Fetch** tab and add the URL of the JSON file containing the list of chat bot UI data.

2. **Configure the Trigger Component**:
   - Add a Checkbox and name the component 'Populate'.
   - Open the Data Source settings and click the **Trigger** tab.
   - Select the 'Populate' checkbox from the form as the trigger to execute the event.

3. **Define the Triggered Event**:
   - Set the Triggered Event to match the Data Source event, for example, 'populateState'.
To generate a data table component for code tools, you can use the following approaches:

1. **UiPath**: You can use UiPath to generate a data table from unstructured data. The process involves using the Screen Scraping Wizard to extract data and then using the Generate Data Table activity to create a table from the scraped data.

2. **Form.io**: Form.io provides a Data Grid component that allows you to add multiple rows of field groupings. This can be used to create a structured data table by defining key-value pairs and customizing the grid's behavior.

3. **Commercetools UIKit**: This library provides a DataTable component that can render tabular data. You need to define the `rows` and `columns` lists as arrays of objects, where each column object has a unique `key` and a `label` for the header.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of chatbot settings, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Table Schema**:
   - Identify the key settings for your chatbot, such as goal, tone, message length, and triggers.
   - Create a table with columns for each setting, ensuring the data types are appropriate (e.g., text, boolean, integer).

2. **Populate the Table**:
   - Use an API or a data source to fetch the chatbot settings and populate the table.
   - Ensure the data is structured and can be easily updated or refreshed.

3. **Configure the Data Table Component**:
   - Use a UI framework like Form.io or Power Apps to create a data table component.
   - Configure the component to display the chatbot settings in a table format, allowing for sorting, filtering, and customization as needed.

  USER PROMPT/QUERY: Generate a data table compoennt for handlign Ai Prompt data

  --- PERPLEXITY WEB SEARCH RESULTS ---

  RESULTS: To generate a data table component for handling AI prompt data, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Data Structure**: Determine the columns and fields required for your AI prompt data. For example, you might need columns such as `prompt_id`, `prompt_text`, `response`, `confidence_score`, and `created_at`.

2. **Create a Data Table**: Use a library like Pandas in Python to create a DataFrame from your data. Here's an example of how you might do this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example data
data = {
    'prompt_id': [1, 2, 3],
    'prompt_text': ['Example Prompt 1', 'Example Prompt 2', 'Example Prompt 3'],
    'response': ['Generated Response 1', 'Generated Response 2', 'Generated Response 3'],
    'confidence_score': [0.8, 0.9, 0.7],
    'created_at': ['2024-09-01', '2024-09-02', '2024-09-03']
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display DataFrame
print(df)
```

3. **Store and Manage Data**: If you need to store this data in a database, you can use a service like Supabase as described in. This involves creating a table with the necessary columns and then inserting data into it.

4. **Visualize Data**: Use a library like Matplotlib or Plotly to visualize the data in a table format. For example, you can use `df.to_html()` to convert the DataFrame into an HTML table for easier visualization.

Hereâ€™s a complete example combining these steps:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example data
data = {
    'prompt_id': [1, 2, 3],
    'prompt_text': ['Example Prompt 1', 'Example Prompt 2', 'Example Prompt 3'],
    'response': ['Generated Response 1', 'Generated Response 2', 'Generated Response 3'],
    'confidence_score': [0.8, 0.9, 0.7],
    'created_at': ['2024-09-01', '2024-09-02', '2024-09-03']
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display DataFrame
print(df)

# Convert DataFrame to HTML table for visualization
html_table = df.to_html()

# Print HTML table
print(html_table)
```

This approach ensures that your AI prompt data is organized and easily manageable, making it simpler to analyze and visualize.
