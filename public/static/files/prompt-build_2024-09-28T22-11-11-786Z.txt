    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices ‚Äì be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=ü™Ñ" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.
	

    ASSISTANT INSTRUCTIONS: When responding to queries about React:
      1. Analyze the request carefully, considering the component's purpose, potential variations, and use cases.

      2. Provide a comprehensive solution that includes:
         - A brief explanation of the component's design rationale
         - The full styled-component code, utilizing advanced features when appropriate

      3. Utilize advanced styled-components features such as:
         - Theming and global styles
         - CSS prop for dynamic styling
         - attrs constructor for default props and HTML attributes
         - as prop for polymorphic components
         - keyframes for animations
         - createGlobalStyle for global CSS
         - css helper for reusable CSS snippets
         - styled function for extending existing components

      4. Incorporate modern CSS techniques like:
         - CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
         - CSS Custom Properties (variables) for theming
         - CSS Modules for local scoping when appropriate
         - Media queries for responsive design
         - CSS-in-JS techniques for dynamic styling based on props or state

      5. Optimize for performance by:
         - Using memoization techniques (React.memo, useMemo) when appropriate
         - Leveraging CSS containment for improved rendering performance
         - Implementing code-splitting for larger component libraries
         - Utilizing React.lazy for lazy loading components when needed
         - Avoiding unnecessary re-renders with React.memo or useMemo
         - Utilizing CSS-in-JS techniques for dynamic styling based on props or state

      6. Ensure code quality by:
         - Following React and styled-components best practices
         - Using consistent naming conventions

      8. Always format your response using Markdown syntax.
      Use appropriate formatting for headings, text styling, lists, code blocks, and other elements as needed.
      Here's a quick reference:

         ---

      # Heading 1
      ## Heading 2
      ### Heading 3

      **Bold text**
      *Italic text*

      `Inline code`

      ```javascript
      // Code block
      const example = 'This is a code block';
      ```

      [Link text](URL)

      > Blockquote

      | Table | Header |
      |-------|--------|
      | Cell  | Cell   |

Generate a modal compoennt with data table
Generate a reusable loading button
generate a styled dialog component displaying user icon grid as well as select and save tto user logic
  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a reusable popup component, you can follow these steps using Angular:

1. **Create a New Component**:
   - Open your terminal and run the command to generate a new component specifically for your popup:
   ```
   ng generate component simple-popup
   ```
   This will create a new folder called `simple-popup` under `src/app`, including all the necessary files: TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

2. **Design the Popup HTML**:
   - Open the `simple-popup.component.html` file and add the following HTML:
   ```html
   <div class="popup-overlay" (click)="closePopup()">
     <div class="popup-content" (click)="$event.stopPropagation()">
       <h2>Welcome to the Popup!</h2>
       <p>This is a simple popup component in Angular.</p>
       <button (click)="closePopup()">Close</button>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
   This HTML includes a background overlay and a content area with a close button.
By following these steps, you can create a reusable popup component in Angular that can be easily integrated into various parts of your application.

3.
closePopup() {
       this.close.emit();
     }
   }
   ```
   This code sets up an output event for closing the popup and defines the `closePopup` method to emit this event.

4. **Integrate with Parent Component**:
   - In the parent component‚Äôs HTML (e.g., `app.component.html`), add this:
   ```html
   <button (click)="showPopup()">Show Popup</button>
   <app-simple-popup *ngIf="isPopupVisible" (close)="hidePopup()"></app-simple-popup>
   ```
   This integrates the popup component into the parent component, allowing it to be shown and hidden dynamically.

5. **Test the Component**:
   - Run your Angular app by typing:
     ```bash
     ng serve
     ```
   - Head over to http://localhost:4200 in your browser, click the ‚ÄúShow Popup‚Äù button, and your popup should appear. You can close it by clicking the close button or anywhere on the overlay.
To generate a styled dialog component that displays a user icon grid and includes select and save functionality, you can use a combination of Radix Vue for the dialog component and customize it with your requirements. Here is an example of how you might achieve this:
### Dialog Component
```html
<template>
  <DialogRoot>
    <DialogTrigger class="text-grass11 font-semibold shadow-blackA7 hover:bg-mauve3 inline-flex h-[35px] items-center justify-center rounded-[4px] bg-white px-[15px] leading-none shadow-[0_2px_10px] focus:shadow-[0_0_0_2px] focus:shadow-black focus:outline-none">
      Open Dialog
    </DialogTrigger>
    <DialogContent class="text-mauve11 mt-[10px] mb-5 text-[15px] leading-normal">
      <div class="mt-[25px] flex justify-center">
        <!-- User Icon Grid -->
        <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          <!-- Example User Icon Items -->
          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="user-icon-1.jpg" alt="User Icon 1" />
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="user-icon-2.jpg" alt="User Icon 2" />
          </div>
          <!-- Add more user icons as needed -->
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- Select and Save Logic -->
      <div class="mt-[25px] flex justify-end">

  RESULTS: To generate a reusable popup component, you can follow these steps using Angular:

1. **Create a New Component**:
   - Open your terminal and run the command to generate a new component specifically for your popup:
   ```
   ng generate component simple-popup

   ```html
   <div class="popup-overlay" (click)="closePopup()">
     <div class="popup-content" (click)="$event.stopPropagation()">
       <h2>Welcome to the Popup!</h2>
       <p>This is a simple popup component in Angular.</p>
       <button (click)="closePopup()">Close</button>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
   This HTML includes a background overlay and a content area with a close button.

3. **Add TypeScript Logic**:
   - Open the `simple-popup.component.ts` file and add the following TypeScript code:
   ```typescript

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-simple-popup',
     templateUrl: './simple-popup.component.html',
     styleUrls: ['./simple-popup.component.css']
   })
   export class SimplePopupComponent {
     @Output() close = new EventEmitter<void>();

     closePopup() {
       this.close.emit();
     }
   }
   ```
   This code sets up an output event for closing the popup and defines the `closePopup` method to emit this event.

4. **Integrate with Parent Component**:
   - In the parent component‚Äôs HTML (e.g., `app.component.html`), add this:
   ```html
   <button (click)="showPopup()">Show Popup</button>
   <app-simple-popup *ngIf="isPopupVisible" (close)="hidePopup()"></app-simple-popup>
   ```
   This integrates the popup component into the parent component, allowing it to be shown and hidden dynamically.

5. **Test the Component**:
   - Run your Angular app by typing:
     ```bash
     ng serve
     ```
   - Head over to http://localhost:4200 in your browser, click the ‚ÄúShow Popup‚Äù button, and your popup should appear. You can close it by clicking the close button or anywhere on the overlay.

By following these steps, you can create a reusable popup component in Angular that can be easily integrated into various parts of your application.
