    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices – be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  SUMMARY OF CHAT HISTORY: [object Object]
  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data related to UI components, you can use the following guidelines and example code from the provided sources:

### Key Components and Features

1. **Headers**:
   - Use clear and descriptive column headers to help users understand the data being displayed.

2. **Rows and Cells**:
   - Ensure each row and cell is well-defined and easy to read. Use proper formatting and ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.

3. **Pagination**:
   - Implement pagination to handle large datasets effectively. This helps in splitting the data into manageable pages.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filtering and sorting features to allow users to quickly find specific data. This can be achieved through dropdown menus or search bars.
To generate a data table component for code tools, you can use the following approaches:

1. **UiPath**: You can use UiPath to generate a data table from unstructured data. The process involves using the Screen Scraping Wizard to extract data and then using the Generate Data Table activity to create a table from the scraped data.

2. **Form.io**: Form.io provides a Data Grid component that allows you to add multiple rows of field groupings. This can be used to create a structured data table by defining key-value pairs and customizing the grid's behavior.

3. **Commercetools UIKit**: This library provides a DataTable component that can render tabular data. You need to define the `rows` and `columns` lists as arrays of objects, where each column object has a unique `key` and a `label` for the header.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data, particularly for UI libraries that have been upserted into a vector database for PDB (Protein Data Bank), you can use the following steps and components from various UI libraries:

### Using Frames X Design System

1. **Choose a Table Component**: Frames X offers a versatile Table component that can be customized to fit your needs.
2. **Customize Each Cell Independently**: Combine and stack Table Cell components to create tables where each cell can be customized independently.
3. **Structure Variants**: Use the two structure variants, row and column-based approaches, to organize your data efficiently.

### Using Material React Table
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data that has been upserted into a vector database for projects, you can utilize various UI libraries that offer robust table components. Here are some options and their key features:

1. **Frames X Design System**:
   - **Features**: Provides over 20K components in 80+ different interface categories, including two structure variants for tables with row and column-based approaches. It offers customization options and can be used to create tables with customizable cells.

2. **React Data Table Component**:
   - **Features**: Includes built-in sorting, pagination, selectable rows, expandable rows, and customizable styling. It is responsive and themeable, making it suitable for dynamic data presentation.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data, particularly for tracking UI library documents that have been upserted into a database for projects, you can use a combination of **TanStack Table** and **Material UI**. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Install `material-react-table` and `@material-ui/core` using npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install material-react-table @material-ui/core
   ```

2. **Set Up the Table Component**:
   - Import the necessary components and hooks:
   ```javascript
   import { useMemo } from 'react';
   import { MaterialReactTable, useMaterialReactTable, type MRT_ColumnDef } from 'material-react-table';
   import { TableContainer, Table, TableHead, TableBody, TableRow, TableCell, Paper, TableSortLabel } from '@material-ui/core';
   ```

  :model-value="selectedRows" 
  :size="'md'" 
  :title="'Custom Table'" 
  :headers="['Column 1', 'Column 2', 'Column 3']" 
  :sortable="true" 
  :headers-align="'left'" 
  :rows="[{'row1': 'value1', 'row2': 'value2'}, {'row3': 'value3', 'row4': 'value4'}]" 
  :hoverable="true" 
  :search="true" 
  :search-placeholder="'Search'" 
  :pagination="true" 
  :page="1" 
  :page-size="20"
/>
```

### Using UI Bakery's Table Component

UI Bakery's `Table` component also supports dynamic configuration of columns and provides various properties to customize the table. Here’s an example:

```javascript
const columns = [
  { prop: 'id', type: 'number', primaryKey: true, color: 'danger' },
  { prop: 'full_name', type: 'string' },
  { prop: 'avatar', type: 'image' },
  { prop: 'email', type: 'link' },
];

const tableData = [
  { id: 1, full_name: 'John Doe', avatar: 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg', email: 'john.doe@example.com' },
  { id: 2, full_name: 'Jane Doe', avatar: 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg', email: 'jane.doe@example.com' },
];

// Example usage in UI Bakery's Table component
```

React Table with TanStack provides a robust way to create custom tables with dynamic columns and various configurations. Here’s an example:

```javascript
import { ColumnDef } from "@tanstack/react-table";
import { IEmployee } from "../../utils/types";

const columns: ColumnDef<IEmployee>[] = [
  {
    header: "ID",
    accessorKey: "id_number",
    cell: (info) => info.getValue().substring(0, 10), // Custom cell rendering
  },
  {
    header: "First Name",
    accessorKey: "firstName",
  },
  {
    header: "Last Name",
    accessorKey: "lastName",
  },
];

const data = [
  { id_number: 1, firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" },
  { id_number: 2, firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" },
];

// Example usage in React Table component
```
