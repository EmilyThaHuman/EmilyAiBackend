    SYSTEM PROMPT: 
	You are an expert React/Tailwind developer
	Your mission is to transform detailed descriptions or compelling images into stunning single page apps using HTML and the versatility of TailwindCSS. 
	Ensure your creations are seamless in both dark and light modes! Your designs should be responsive and adaptable across all devices – be it desktop, tablet, or mobile.
	
	*Design Guidelines:*
	- Utilize placehold.co for placeholder images and descriptive alt text.
	- For interactive elements, leverage modern ES6 JavaScript and native browser APIs for enhanced functionality.
	- Inspired by shadcn, we provide the following colors which handle both light and dark mode:

		```css
		--background
		--foreground
		--primary
			--border
		--input
		--ring
		--primary-foreground
		--secondary
		--secondary-foreground
		--accent
		--accent-foreground
		--destructive
		--destructive-foreground
		--muted
		--muted-foreground
		--card
		--card-foreground
		--popover
		--popover-foreground
		```

	- Make sure the app looks exactly like the detailed description.
	- Pay close attention to background color, text color, font size, font family, 
	padding, margin, border, etc. Match the colors and sizes exactly.
	- Use the exact text from the detailed description.
	- Do not add comments in the code such as "<!-- Add other navigation links as needed -->" and "<!-- ... other news items ... -->" in place of writing the full code. WRITE THE FULL CODE.
	- Repeat elements as needed to match the detailed description. For example, if there are 15 items, the code should have 15 items. DO NOT LEAVE comments like "<!-- Repeat for each news item -->" or bad things will happen.
	- For images, use placeholder images from https://placehold.co and include a detailed description of the image in the alt text so that an image generation AI can generate the image later.
	
	In terms of libraries,
	
	- Use these script to include React so that it can run on a standalone page:
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react/18.2.0/files/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/react-dom/18.2.0/files/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	  <script src="https://registry.npmmirror.com/@babel/standalone/7.23.6/files/babel.js"></script>
	
	- Use this script to include Tailwind: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
	- You can use Google Fonts
	- Font Awesome for icons: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css"></link>
	
	Prefer using these colors when appropriate, for example:

	```
	<button class="bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80">Click me</button>
	<span class="text-muted-foreground">This is muted text</span>
	```

	*Implementation Rules:*
	- Only implement elements within the `<body>` tag, don't bother with `<html>` or `<head>` tags.
	- Avoid using SVGs directly. Instead, use the `<img>` tag with a descriptive title as the alt attribute and add .svg to the placehold.co url, for example:

	```
	<img aria-hidden="true" alt="magic-wand" src="/icons/24x24.svg?text=🪄" />
	```
	Return only the full code in <html></html> tags.

  RELEVANT DOCS: To generate a data table component for organizing projects, you can use a combination of tools and features from various platforms. Here’s a concise overview:

1. **Form.io**: For creating a dynamic data table within a form, you can use the `Data Grid` component, which allows users to add multiple rows of field groupings and customize how the grid saves and displays the data.

2. **UI Bakery**: This platform offers a robust `Table` component that supports various data types, including dynamic column configuration through JavaScript. It also includes features like filtering, sorting, and editing directly from the table.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of data related to UI components, you can use the following guidelines and example code from the provided sources:

### Key Components and Features

1. **Headers**:
   - Use clear and descriptive column headers to help users understand the data being displayed.

2. **Rows and Cells**:
   - Ensure each row and cell is well-defined and easy to read. Use proper formatting and ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.

3. **Pagination**:
   - Implement pagination to handle large datasets effectively. This helps in splitting the data into manageable pages.

4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Add filtering and sorting features to allow users to quickly find specific data. This can be achieved through dropdown menus or search bars.
To generate a data table component for organizing a list of project data, you can use the following approaches:

1. **Material React Table**: This library offers a comprehensive data grid component with features like pagination, sorting, filtering, and row selection. You can customize it extensively using Material UI components and the `useMaterialReactTable` hook.

2. **TanStack Table**: This library provides a robust set of features for creating tables, including client-side sorting, filtering, and pagination. It is highly customizable and can be integrated with other React components.

3. **SVAR DataGrid (Svelte)**: If you are using Svelte, SVAR DataGrid offers a ready-to-use UI component that supports sorting, searching, and paging functionality. It is lightweight and easy to integrate with Svelte applications.

### Example Using Material React Table

Here is a basic example of creating a data table using Material React Table:
To generate a data table component for organizing styles, themes, and animations for each workspace in your project, you can use a combination of the features from various table components. Here’s a suggested approach:

1. **Grafana Table Visualization**:
   - Use Grafana's table visualization to display data in a flexible and customizable manner. You can add columns for styles, themes, and animations and use field overrides to customize the display of each column.
   - For example, you could have columns like "Style", "Theme", "Animation", and add custom cell data rendering to show detailed information about each style and theme.
To generate a data table component for code tools, you can use the following approaches:

1. **UiPath**: You can use UiPath to generate a data table from unstructured data. The process involves using the Screen Scraping Wizard to extract data and then using the Generate Data Table activity to create a table from the scraped data.

2. **Form.io**: Form.io provides a Data Grid component that allows you to add multiple rows of field groupings. This can be used to create a structured data table by defining key-value pairs and customizing the grid's behavior.

3. **Commercetools UIKit**: This library provides a DataTable component that can render tabular data. You need to define the `rows` and `columns` lists as arrays of objects, where each column object has a unique `key` and a `label` for the header.

### Example Using Material React Table

Here is a basic example of creating a data table using Material React Table:

```javascript
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import { MaterialReactTable, useMaterialReactTable } from 'material-react-table';
import { type Person } from './types';

const data: Person[] = [
  { name: { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' }, address: '261 Erdman Ford', city: 'East Daphne', state: 'Kentucky' },
  { name: { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Doe' }, address: '32188 Larkin Turnpike', city: 'Omaha', state: 'Nebraska' },
];

const Example = () => {
  const columns = useMemo<MRT_ColumnDef<Person>[]>(() => [
    { accessorKey: 'name.firstName', header: 'First Name', size: 150 },
    { accessorKey: 'name.lastName', header: 'Last Name', size: 150 },
    { accessorKey: 'address', header: 'Address', size: 200 },
    { accessorKey: 'city', header: 'City', size: 150 },
    { accessorKey: 'state', header: 'State', size: 150 },
  ], []);

  const table = useMaterialReactTable({ columns, data });

  return <MaterialReactTable table={table} />;
};

export default Example;
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple data table with basic columns and data using Material React Table.

### Example Using TanStack Table

Here is a basic example of creating a data table using TanStack Table:

```javascript
import { ColumnDef } from '@tanstack/react-table';
import { IEmployee } from './types';

const columns: ColumnDef<IEmployee>[] = [
  { header: 'ID', accessorKey: 'id_number' },
  { header: 'First Name', accessorKey: 'firstName' },
  { header: 'Last Name', accessorKey: 'lastName' },
  { header: 'Email', accessorKey: 'email' },
  { header: 'Department', accessorKey: 'department' },
  { header: 'Date Joined', accessorKey: 'dateJoined', cell: (info) => (info.getValue() as string).substring(0,10) },
];

const data = [
  { id_number: 1, firstName: 'Tandi', lastName: 'Withey', email: 'twithey0@arizona.edu', department: 'Marketing', dateJoined: '2014-10-23T07:29:35Z' },
];

const ReactTable = () => {
  const [globalFilter, setGlobalFilter] = useState('');
  
  const table = useReactTable({
    columns,
    data,
    state: { globalFilter },
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
    getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
    onGlobalFilterChange: setGlobalFilter,
  });

  return (
    <TableContainer>
      <Input value={globalFilter || ""} onChange={(e) => setGlobalFilter(e.target.value)} placeholder="Search" />
      <Table {...table.getHeaderGroups()} />
      <Table {...table.getRowModel()} />
      <Table {...table.getFooterGroups()} />
    </TableContainer>
  );
};

export default ReactTable;
```

This example demonstrates how to create a simple data table with basic columns and data using TanStack Table.

### Example Using SVAR DataGrid (Svelte)

Here is a basic example of creating a data table using SVAR DataGrid in Svelte:

```javascript
import { Grid } from '@wx/trial-svelte-grid';
import { Willow } from '@wx/trial-svelte-grid';

const columns = [
  { id: 'remote', header: 'Remote', width: 80, resize: true },
  { id: 'name', header: 'Name', flexgrow: 1, resize: true },
  // Add other columns as needed
];

const data = [
  { remote: 'Home', name: 'John Doe', position: 'Developer', status
